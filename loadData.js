Our records indicate that you have purchased one of the products listed in this notification through the Amazon.com website.This notification to inspect includes all Fisher-Price Rock N' Play infant recliner seats called sleepers. The sleeper is designed for babies up to 25 pounds and is composed of a soft plastic seat held by a metal rocking frame. The product has a removable, fabric cover that is sold in 14 patterns and color palettes.The affected product has been sold at mass merchandise stores nationwide and online since September 2009 for between $50 and $85. Mold can develop between the removable seat cushion and the hard plastic frame of the sleeper when it remains wet/moist or is infrequently cleaned, posing a risk of exposure to mold to infants sleeping in the product. Although mold is not present at the time of purchase, mold growth can occur after use of the product.Customers should immediately check for mold under the removable seat cushion. Dark brown, gray or black spots can indicate the presence of mold. If mold is found, customers should immediately stop using the product and contact Fisher-Price at (800) 432-5437, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET Monday through Friday, or visit [...] for cleaning instructions or further assistance.You may also find additional details about the notification in the CPSC bulletin at:[...]If you purchased this product for someone else, please notify the recipient immediately and provide them with the information in the CPSC bulletin concerning these safety issues.We regret the inconvenience this notification has caused you but trust you will understand that the safety of our customers is our highest priority.Thanks for shopping at Amazon.com.Sincerely,Customer ServiceAmazon.comwww.amazon.comso you determine if you want to take the risk.  I don't - this is going in the trash.", "review_id": "R3I2AXU0J142XR", "asin": "B002M77N22", "proba": "100.0%", "product_name": "Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow (Discontinued by Manufacturer)"}, {"id": 2, "title": "Plastic, plastic, and more plastic", "review": "I can see why there are so many good reviews on this high chair.  The design looks great, the seat covering is easy to clean, the base folds up, and it can be used as a swing for infants.  I felt this was a great purchase too when we first brought it home.  6 months later, my opinion on this chair has changed quite a bit.The first thing I noticed right out of the box was that the entire thing is made of plastic.  The only metal parts on this chair are the screws and a few internal cables and rods.  As long as the plastic is sturdy enough, it should be fine however, there are a few stress points on the chair that I feel should have used a different material or at least a stronger piece of plastic.  After 6 months of use, I've noticed that the tray is beginning to sag noticeably from its own weight.  Any round object will roll to the far end of the tray.  For a $300 chair, one would expect the use of better materials.The base is folded up by lifting a plastic lever on each side of the chair.  About 3 months after purchase, the cable that is attached to one of levers popped off.  We rarely folded up the base so I figured it wasn't a major problem since at least the side that we push against the wall still worked.  Then about 5 months after the purchase, the other side popped off.  Now both sides of the base cannot be folded up.  As hard as I tried, the cables could not be reattached.  I also noticed that the lever on the back of the chair that allows you to recline the seat is very hard to pull.  It feels like the plastic lever is bending and ready to snap from the tension of the cable.  Unless the lever is pulled all the way, the seat will not recline.I would not recommend using the swing feature to anyone unless your baby is very young and cannot move their arms around.  My baby was just beginning to learn how to move his arms to touch things by the time we purchased this chair.  He was still well within the recommended weight limit for the swing so we gave it a try.  As he was swinging, he tried touching one of the arms that was attached to the seat and got his fingers pinched.  The arms that are attached to the chair crosses very closely to the arms that are attached to the base.  As the chair swings, there is a very strong possibility that a child will get their fingers pinched or even seriously crushed between the two arms.  The clearance between the two arms as they cross is very small.  Its almost like a scissor action with two arms crossing back and forth well within reach of the child.  Needless to say, we never used the swing after the first try.I finally called the Peg-Perego customer service line regarding the broken levers and was told they would be sending me replacement arms for the chair but I would have to dissemble the chair myself to replace them.  There are no repair locations in my area so I have no choice.  They also informed me that they would have to get back to me on the total shipping and handling charge for the replacement parts.  Yes, they even charge you for handling.  I can't wait to find out how much this warranty fix is going to cost me.UPDATEIts been a week and I still haven't heard back from the Peg-Perego customer service dept on the shipping & handling charge for the replacement parts.  Just this morning, the plastic cover on the piece that the t-bar attaches to fell off while we were placing our baby in the chair.  We were not using the t-bar and rarely do.  It took me several minutes to find the small metal spring that was underneath the button on the cover.  The small metal spring is a choking hazard and had my wife not noticed the cover falling off, our baby could have found it before us.  I just emailed them again to follow up on the first call and to report this new issue.2ND UPDATEAfter another email and a follow up call, I spoke their customer service and was told the shipping and handling would be $30.  I asked if the arms would come with instructions on how to disassemble and reassemble the chair and was told that the instructions that came with the chair should show me how.  After I hung up, I looked through the manual and could not find any instructions on this.  I guess I will have to see if I can figure it out on my own when the parts arrive.3RD UPDATEI received the replacement part about a week and a half after they charged my credit card.  They ended up sending the entire base and arms so no major disassembling was required.  The seat and wheels were easily removed from the old chair and attached to the new base.  The customer service rep said the part they were sending would also address the other two issues of the sagging tray and the t-bar base cover falling off but it does not.  The slots that the tray is inserted into and the t-bar base cover are totally separate from the base they sent to me.  I decided to just live with the sagging tray and wrapped the cover back on with strong tape after removing the button and spring.FINAL UPDATEWell, my two kids grew out of this chair over a year ago so I've had it off to the side of our dining room, unused.  I left the bases down out of fear that the cables would pop off again.  I decided this chair could be used for haircuts since it keeps them high up and the seatbelt keeps the younger one from squirming out of the seat to escape. After their haircuts, I decided to put the chair away in a closet which required me to fold the bases up.  So I pull the first lever and the cable immediately popped out just like it did when it was new.  I tried pulling the lever for the other side and it just as easily pops out.  They really need to redesign this cable and lever.", "review_id": "R3QS2EW7CJNIEO", "asin": "B017O6NW5M", "proba": "100.0%", "product_name": "Peg Perego Tatamia Stripes, Grey"}, {"id": 3, "title": "FALL ALERT - My 6 month old fell out of the swing though fastened by seat belt", "review": "My 6 month old daughter was fastened to the Fisher Price G2609 Nature's Touch cradle swing. She has been using it since she was born. The straps were secure and the belts fastened. She begain to reach for the little toys that rotate above the seat and wouldsit back down. She repeated the motions for about 10 minutes. She then reached again and then fell down over the side and landed on her shoulder and head  while her leg was caught on the fastened seatbelts. The problem appeared to be the way the seat belts are secured to the plastic seat. There is a sall slit where you stick in the end of the seat bellt and a fold at the end of the seat belt opens up and is suppose to not come out of the slit unless you fold it in a certain way and pull on it. This seemed to happen by chance and I deem it a very poor and unsafe design to secure a seat belt to an infant seat. My baby suffered tons of scratches and shoulder and head injuries but nothing serious but I believe tihs is a very dangerous product that utilizes a very dangerous mechanism to secure seat belts.", "review_id": "R146Y1TCSRUDEZ", "asin": "B01G7KAKU6", "proba": "100.0%", "product_name": "Fisher-Price Starlight Cradle 'n Swing"}, {"id": 4, "title": "SAFETY WARNING - screws become loose.  And Has Many Issues", "review": "Edited to Add 6/4/2010:  Just wanted to add that Peg Perego gave me a full refund and sent a box and a pre-paid Fed Ex label for me to ship the high chair back.  The customer service was excellent.Edited To Add 5/2/2010:  SAFETY WARNING!  The last of the screws fell out. So the bottom side of the tray that separates the baby's legs is completely off.Edited To Add 5/1/2010: SAFETY WARNING!  Unbelievable.  Another screw fell out on the bottom side of the tray.  This is the third screw to fall out.  Fortunately, I saw it fall before the baby had a chance to swallow it.  I contacted Peg Perego on 4/28/2010 after the second screw fell out and demanded a refund.  To their credit, they said they would give us a refund once we show proof of purchase so we now have to find the receipt.  Also, they did add that they've never had this issue before on the Tatamia (which is relatively a new line) or on any of their Peg Perego high chairs.  I am wondering whether the screw mechanism on the bottom side of the tray are the same for all Peg Perego high chairs. I am wondering whether it is a design defect or a manufacturing defect.  Something is wrong.  Even IF my baby (from when he was 8 months - 12 months) was playing with it, it is a problem because a baby should NOT be able to unscrew sharp screws from the high chair so easily.Edited To Add on 4/28/2010:  SAFETY WARNING!  The screws underneath the tray falls out.  About a month ago, I was lifting our son out of the Tatamia chair when I saw a screw on my son's lap (almost an inch long with a sharp end).  I realized that it fell off from the bottom of the tray where there are 3 screws.  It scared me because he is at the stage where he puts everything in his mouth.  I was relieved he didn't swallow it and it didn't puncture him.  I had my husband put the screw back in.  Today, my husband was lifting our son out of the chair when he saw another screw on his lap.  We're sure our son is not unscrewing the screw (he is only 11 months old and not dextrous enough. Even so, the design should be such that a child cannot unscrew the screws.) This is unacceptable.  A baby can die if he swallows these screws.  I am downgrading this from 2 stars to 1 star.  I am going to call Peg Perego tomorrow.My husband and I were initially excited to get the Tatamia.  We've been using it for the past 6 months now and we're less than thrilled.  There are several problems with the Tatamia.  (1) The top tray falls off very easily.  Several times, my baby (at 10 months old) managed to get the top tray off... so that left a real mess. I tried to \"click\" in the top tray but it won't click in.  It just rests on the bottom tray.  Since the baby always flips it over, I just use the bottom tray now.  (2) It is difficult to slide the tray in and out of the high chair.  With both your index fingers, you have to position the knob just right to slide it in and out but the right side keeps getting stuck.  (3) My baby first hated sitting in it.  He has now grown accustomed to it but it doesn't look very comfortable.  (4) The plastic device on the back of the seat to enable you to recline or sit-up doesn't work very well.  I thought maybe it was just me until my husband started complaining about the same problem.  (5) The high chair doesn't roll very well.  You can't move the chair sideways so you have to go backwards and then swivel and then go forward. As for the swinging feature, we used it once and it was a pain to get it into that position and back so we never used it since.", "review_id": "R32KEFZ7OZ1J1I", "asin": "B017O6NW5M", "proba": "100.0%", "product_name": "Peg Perego Tatamia Stripes, Grey"}, {"id": 5, "title": "This Product Destroyed My Life ******WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT******DANGEROUS*********", "review": "******************** WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT******************************************* WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT***********************Words cannot even begin to explain the hell I am in thanks to the purchase if this horribly made, incredibly dangerous product!

He also had abrasion to his skin from what i would imagine him dangling and being dragged back and forth across our hard wood floors while still strapped in.

I can't believe they would use such low quality materials for a crib - particularly one that is meant to be converted to a toddler bed (it should be designed for many years of use). I'm disgusted with this company. I should have paid more attention to red flags I saw a few months ago when the paint began bubbling up and flaking off. (By the way, I contacted the company about this, and when I didn't hear back tried again, and received a curt reply: \"Frankly, I would have called you if you had included your phone number,\" rather than simply asking for my number.) As another reviewer said, it's unfortunate that the wheels don't lock. My child learned he was able to scoot the crib simply by holding the railing and wiggling his body, and all the scooting actually caused the screws to come loose.

It can easily be opened by a child. There is no positive lock - only a 1/2 mm bump to hold it in place. Both sides of the cross bar appear ready to fall off at any time.The reclining mechanism will not stay \"up\" and has no gradient recline. It is either \"up\" or \"back\" and can, and does, snap to \"recline\" if any jostling occurs.The head support (the upper blue part) is supposed to lock in place with small buttons, which a) do not fit and b) are so brittle they snapped and stripped out. Hence, the head support is unlikely to hold in place in the event of a fall and will compound injury rather than protect head and shoulders from injury.The mounting device is made of cheap metal and poor quality plastic and fell apart in my hands when I bolted it on to the bike. The bolts themselves were extremely brittle and the heads stripped out (have you ever heard of an allen-head strip out?).The seat rattles like a can of safety pins.

Overall, it seems well made and nice and I would recommend it.I ADDED AN EDIT AT THE BOTTOM AND CHANGED FROM 4 TO 2 STARS!Pros:Adjustable in the leg wells. We had a copilot limo and my 41 inch tall 41lb 3 year old son fit well in the actual seat portion, but his legs had to hang over because he could not fit them in the leg wells. The leg wells were the perfect length for my 32 inch tall 11 month old son, but even he would have outgrown it by 18-24 months and it would have been cramped. But the Kettler has much longer and more adjustable leg wells. However, I feel the actual seat portion is tiny and could/should be a but more generously sized.I like the way it mounts and sits on the bike. I like the rack-less design because you can remove it easily.The bright colors is nice because I feel it makes it more visible.Cons:While the leg wells are a good length to fit my older son, the seat portion is small. The seat is not very deep, wide or tall and I find it to be quite small and cramped for him. I don't see how the seat could accommodate a child that is 50lbs.Not easily adjusted. This is my least favorite part about the seat. In order to adjust the leg wells, you have to unscrew them with a screw driver and reinstall them. And in order to adjust the back height, you have to remove plastic screw and reinstall. I thought they should make it more easily adjusted, without having to literally take it apart and use tools.The instructions are a MESS. All you get is a very poorly drawn, picture only instruction. I am not mechanically inclined, so maybe it is just me. But even my husband thought the instructions were just awful. It literally took me 2 hours to figure it out, and another 45 to get it adjusted just right on the bike.The seat is just basically a small chair on the bike. I prefer the copilot in the sense that it kind of encased your child. Since the seat is so small my sons regularly have shoulders and arms hanging out and over the seat. I could see that ending really badly if I ever fell. With nothing around them to keep them from getting bad road rash, or nothing to keep an arm from getting stuck under in a fall, or to keep a shoulder or head from smacking the ground, I find it a bit unsafe. The copilot has a generously sizes seat that wraps around the child's body, keeping all limbs and body parts within the seat. Seems much safer to have it that way, versus just hanging out and over.Overall, I like the seat, but it could use some improvements, especially for the price.EDIT**** Okay, VERY upset. I have had this seat now for about 3 months, and it was fine at first. My sons were able to fit and ride in it fine at first, then all of a sudden even the SLIGHTEST bump would cause the seat to bounce so much that it would come down and hit the wheel. We adjusted it, and moved it up as high as it would go. It is about 4-5 inches off of my wheel and that is as high as my frame will allow. I am 5' 5\" and I have an average sized women's bike. According to Kettler, it SHOULD work, but doesn't. The bar they are using must be too cheap and got too bendy and floppy and I am REALLY upset about this. Not only is this VERY dangerous because every time it hits my wheel my bike goes off balance, but it should be made better so it does not do this. This seat should not be hitting a wheel.

I also couldn't decide if this should get 2 or 3 stars.  It deserves about 2.5. I live on a fourth floor walk up in NYC so I maticuously researched every available stroller out there before deciding on UPPAbaby Cruz. Some positives are:it has all the perks of a high end stroller such as,easily removable rear and front facing seatnot as heavy as Vistaa rain cover and mosquito netan extra large sun shieldadjustable foot restadjustable handle bar for my tall husbanlarge magnetic peekaboo window.That's all well and good and I paid good money for those conveniences.As for the size of stroller:Yes, the stroller is large and takes up most of trunk in our small Ford Focus but, this doesn't bother me very much. It has fit into every trunk of NYC cabs and I can carry it up and down subway steps with relative ease for a stroller of this size.Onto the negatives:I had to purchase a drink cup holder, and infant insert for the seat, a snack tray, a seat pad for toddler, and better wind/rain shield. All of that totaled more than an additional $100 bucks.I owned this stroller for less than 3 weeks when I got word that there was a recall on the belly bar, so they sent a shield to cover it. I also absolutely hate the straps on this stroller they are not easily adjustable and the point harness is made of thin cheap plastic one of the locking mechanisms constantly bends every time I try to lock it.When I add a 7am warming muff to the stroller she barely fits into the stroller because I can't extend the straps any more. I found this really annoying but dealt with it. Then, one day when I closed the stroller the lock jammed and the bracket on the frame snapped in half like a twig. Mind you, I had no idea that it snapped until my nanny tore her coat on one of the broken shards that is razor sharp. She could have seriously injured herself! Ok so being that the stroller was only used for 5 months I called BuyBuy Baby and they told me to bring it in to be replaced, when I get to the store they told me that used items could not be returned and that I needed to call UPPAbaby. So I did. They immediately sent me a new frame. I did not need to send them pictures or write any hassle claims forms. Therefore, for this reason ONLY I am giving it 3 stars.  Now I have a new frame but the wheels are from the old stroller and showing a lot of wear. They are constantly jamming and getting stuck. The stroller no longer turns on a dime- the way it used to when I first got it. So I had to pop the front wheels off, only to discover that the inner part of the wheel is made with what else? Cheap plastic.  The constant rubbing on the plastic is what is causing the stickiness. I had to spray them with W-40 and now they are working decently but not 100%. Sounds like a lot of work for a stroller that is less than a year old and that costs $500? It is. I look at this way, I could have purchased a cheaper stroller that would have broken and I never would have gotten a replacement, only to spend another $250. And based on other reviews, it looks like I might be needing more replacements. However, I thankfully chose to spend money on a company that does stand by their product. As a recommendation my close friend spent a lot less money on the CitiMini 3 years ago with no problems and is very happy with it.

While I liked the look of this high chair, the quality fell flat! I made the huge mistake of purchasing this product with all of the baby needs that I thought that I would need (that I hadn't received as gifts) on the night that I went into labor. I was that freak who went into labor early and barely felt anything so decided to use the time to finish all last minute purchases. This came back to bite me because we didn't use the highchair until more than 7 months later after we moved and the return window had obviously closed.Why do I hate this chair to the level that I do? It is the most unsafe item I could ever imagine strapping a small baby into. The first problem we noticed was that it can shift from side to side a good 3 inches or so. It basically feels like it could fall apart at any second. The second problem is that the tray does not stay attached. This is such a safety hazard. Our first realization of this was the ONE time (of course) we didn't have the straps on as they were still wet from cleaning. Knowing the straps were not on, we obviously paid 3x the attention as normal. However, we were still beyond stunned when our bouncy boy suddenly shot the tray table onto my lap! After this happened a few times, we crawled under to make sure everything was put together right and it all checked out. His bouncing (which wasn't any more than a normal baby) simply wiggled the clips in a manner that they opened right up. From that day forward he never went in without straps nor without being shoved agains a table/counter/wall that would prevent the tray from flying off. This wasn't much of an issue because he has maybe used the high chair a total of 20 times in his entire life of over 1 year! I am really not liking the cost per use of this purchase!

The \"swing\" feature, as other reviewers have pointed out, can very easily trap a baby's arm. We tried it once but this was such an obvious risk that I couldn't imagine using it.2. Within two months of starting to use the high chair, the internal cables that are supposed to keep the tray table latched on to the chair began to fail. I noticed that the tray began sagging. Within a few weeks of daily use, the tray began to either slide down and fall off spontaneously (staying latched on one side and dangling on the other), or could be kicked off by my active 7 month old with no warning whatsoever. On several occasions, she kicked off the tray, sending dishes and food flying, and in one instance knocking a cup of hot tea out of my hand. Fortunately I was standing far enough away that she was not burned, but I can easily imagine some disastrous scenarios.3. At this point, we gave up on using the tray and just fed her in the high chair using a nearby countertop for her food, spoons, etc. However, I soon realized that the non-wipeable nature of the cotton cover was causing me to hold back from letting her make a big old baby self-feeding mess with bits of mashed fruit, etc.I went to a store and bought a Chicco Polly chair, which was cheaper than this and has a wipeable cover and a rock-solid tray. I haven't looked back. I am sorry that I wasted the money and effort on the Tatamia and am honestly amazed that it hasn't been recalled yet. It seems like a very flawed product to me.We ended up throwing out the tray from the Tatamia and now use it as a booster chair so that our daughter can sit at table with the family at mealtimes.

The outer shipping packaging looked a little rough but the actual Yepp packaging for the seat wasn't harmed.  When I took the seat out to read the directions, set it up on my bike, etc. I noticed One Small (about 8lb too small) Issue. This seat in the Amazon write up states it's maximum weight is 48lb/22kg and that's wonderful, that's part of the reason why I ordered it. Now stay with me, the seat's packaging box also stated 48/22. When I removed the seat from the container the booklet attached to the seat (the one containing the directions, warning, etc) clearly states 40lbs/18kg maximum. Additionally, the saftey sticker attached to the side of the chair also states 40/18. This is not okay! I purchased this seat because of the higher weight limit and the great reviews! I wanted to use this chair for a longer time than most other brands. It's sleek, not bulky like most other rear attach chairs, fairly light weight, and it attaches to the seat post. All super fabulous things! As soon as I saw this I stopped in my tracks and contacted Amazon Customer Service via phone. Five stars for Customer Service! After explaining what my issue was she recommended sending out a replacement seat. Good! I really want this seat, I just want one that's rated for the advertised 48lbs. I'll be returning the first seat, and crossing my fingers I get the correct seat on round two. I tell you, this was one of the strangest things. At first, (while I was upset) I'd accused Amazon of writing their product up incorrectly and for that I appolgise. After searching more online, even the YEPP website says this seat is rated 48lb. Go figure I ended up with the one (fingers crossed its the only one like this!) rouge 40lb seat.I really hope when my second bike set arrives (in a week :-/) I can update my review to 5 Stars. It would have been nice if the replacement shipping could have been faster. I have a helmet wearing Toddler who's wanting to ride with Mommy.* UPDATE* 8/1/13Three seats later and still NO 48lb Seat in our hands.Seat #2 never even showed up, I guess it got lost somewhere in TN UPS Shipping land and never made it to me. Three calls to UPS (No help from them unless its 0001 hrs of the next business day after your expected delivery date), but One call to Amazon CS at 9pm did help in getting a third seat sent out. So seat #2's weight limit, still unknown.Seat #3. By this time I'm crossing my fingers hoping \"Third time's a charm\"... No Luck! The seat arrived with expedited shipping (Thanks again Corin S) but another da*n 40lb seat! Talk about being frustrated/upset/all range of emotions in thinking I'll never get my kid on the back of the bike before he's 50lbs (he's currently 30lbs)! Having learned from seat One what to look for, I simply opened the box checked the safety sticker and pamphlet. I saw 18kg/40lb, told my boy it was ANOTHER wrong seat, closed the box back up, taped it, and called Amazon CS again to return it. On Friday 7/26/13 Amazon CS told me the seat would be placed under Review and be put on hold from them selling anymore Until the issue was resolved. I'm not positive if this has happened yet or not. As I have mentioned many times before the Yepp Box says 22/48, but the actual seat (once you open the box...) says ONLY 18/40. I also emailed the Yepp website looking for answers to this issue, No Response from them BTW. So I did what any Good Momma would do and reported the seat/Yepp to CPSC for them to look more into. I'm completely done with Yepp seats.*Not a sales pitch, only MY experience* That same evening (my search for a higher weight seat hadn't stopped) I emailed the guys of BoBike for some product information. BoBikeUSA responded the same business day of my inquiry about the weight capacity of their Maxi seat (it IS rated for 48lb and I spoke/emailed a real person). The look of the seat is similar in that I can get an all Black seat (I don't like the multicolored seats, it looks tacky), and still a sleek look. After many emailed back and forth of questions/answers I decided to get the BoBike seat (Maxi City), the City does require a rack. (They have others that attach via the seat post.) the price is about the same (actually, a little bit cheaper..) and BoBike offers Free Shipping too, if that's a selling point you look for.I DO NOT recommend the YEPP MAXI SEAT.

I asked her to purchase it.  I had done extensive research and really liked the features it included, such as the quick on/off, the handle bar for my son, and the foot straps.  I loved the fact that it was rated to 30 pounds and 3 years old, as my son is large for his age.Fast forward, to this spring.  I was excited to give my 15 month old his first bicycle ride.  So we mounted the seat correctly, put on our helmets, buckled him in and set off.  Shortly after our ride began, I noticed that the buckle on one side had come undone and he had gotten his feet loose.  I stopped, a but confused, rebuckled him and set off again.  Sort time later the buckle was again un-done.  I remastered it, checked it several times and made sure it was secure.  We finished our ride without further incident.  But a few weeks later on our next ride, it happened again.  This time, I watched closely to figure it out.  My 15 month old is 26 pounds and 34\" tall.  He fully fills out the straps.  In fact the straps are so tight on him that the seat can come unbuckled easily.  So easily, I could do it with one hand and so, it turns out, could my son.  He's only 15 months old.  The seat is rated to 30 pounds and 3 years.  This should not be happening.Unfortunately, Thuley won't take the seat back to exchange for the larger seat, and since it was over 3 months before it was warm enough to try it out after Christmas it is too late to send it back.  I've contacted Thule twice.  They claim this is not a design flaw and the fact that my son is within their specifications, yet is too big for the seat is just something outside of their control.  Here's their exact quote: \"The product specifications are based on averages and there always will be cases falling outside those parameters.\"So my advice is to avoid this bicycle seat.  If I had not been paying more attention, my son could have fallen out of the seat once the buckle came un-done.  And the customer service is not what I'd expect from such a name brand.

I chose this for my baby registry because I heard it was one of the best and was so excited to have received it! However, after using it for 7 months, the quality has shown its true colors. The legs were very sturdy at first, but now it wobbles if you push it side to side - I rarely move it, so not sure how that happened. The cushions have started to peel, because if you don't wipe it immediately and something sticks to it, it will rip the material when you try to clean it off, even with a soft sponge or rag. Then once it rips, the material underneath absorbs water every time you clean it and it has turned brown, which I'm assuming is some type of mold/mildew. The Velcro that holds the cushions on the seat stopped working a few months ago, so they only lasted about 2 months. Lastly the tray is two pieces and it gets water trapped inside when you wash it in the sink, and food particles get stuck in between, so I can only imagine what's on the inside of the tray. That's a huge safety hazard if you ask me and a huge design flaw. Anywhere that plastic meets plastic on this high chair, food gets traps and the only way to get it out would be to use a toothpick or something of that nature. Babies are messy and for how much this high chair costs, it's design should be able to handle food messes, which it cannot. Parents are busy and shouldn't have to take apart the high chair or use a toothpick to get trapped food particles out.

Our son is 7-months old and is small for his age.  I like it better than the bumbo seat we had for our older son because the bumbo had the rounded leg holes that make it difficult to get the baby in and out.  This one has straight leg holes making it much easier to seat your baby and remove him/her from the seat.  Also, I like that the tray snaps in from the sides - unlike the bumbo (we had an older version) where the tray has to be snapped onto the top and bottom of the center piece between the legs.  I was always concerned I would pinch my baby's skin.  Anyway, here's what I don't really like:1.  The tray is easy to get out from underneath but not easy to return to that position.  Any Mom knows that the best items are those that can be used \"one-handed\".  If I've taken my son out of the seat and am holding him, it would be nice to be able to slide the tray into the storage area under the seat with the other hand.  Frankly, I struggle to get this tray underneath the seat using both hands.  If it isn't perfectly aligned, it won't slide back.2.  Safety note:  on one occasion, my husband put my son into the seat and did not strap him in and did not put the tray on (obviously that's our fault!)  We keep the seat on our kitchen table for him in the mornings so he can see all of the activity and play with his toys.  I turned around and heard a thud and yep, you guessed it, he tipped out of the seat and hit his head on the table.  No harm, no foul, he was fine, just a little bump so I'm saying this to caution parents that you HAVE to use the safety strap.  The center piece between the leg holes looks like it would be high enough to keep your child from tilting out, but that's not what it's designed to do.3.  It would be nice if there was a way to affix the straps to the sides (maybe a little Velcro or a couple of little nubs.  I find that every time I go to strap my little guy in, I'm having to reach under him and yank out the straps.  This is a common problem with most seats for infants, but I still think it would make it so much easier if someone would design something to make our lives a little easier in this regard.I'm giving this 3 stars for items 1 and 3 above.  Item 2 is our fault but I thought it was worth mentioning to set some expectations when you buy the seat.  I just got a look at the new bumbo and given that the tray looks easier to store, I might have gone that route if I'd seen in first!***UPDATE I had my son strapped in with the tray attached - he's 8 months old and small for his age.. I went to take him out so I removed the tray and set it on the floor in front of the seat and my son leaned forward to grab the tray and the seat tipped forward while he was strapped in.  I grabbed him before he hit his head but then decided I needed to get a new seat.  I went with the Bumbo Multi and like it much better - it's much more stable and the tray is awesome - I can put it in place with one hand and put it in it's holder one handed as well.", "review_id": "R1B5BO7VWKV4IO", "asin": "B00WOPQJMW", "proba": "100.0%", "product_name": "Ingenuity Baby Base 2-in-1, Mint"}, {"id": 50, "title": "Swing RECALLED.", "review": "FYI - This swing has been RECALLED.

And that's where the positives have to stop.We purchased this crib in September 2009.  The first headboard (the solid piece along the back-top) had a huge dent in it.  So we contacted LaJobi and they shipped us a new one.  The second one came scratched with a bad paint job.  We contacted them again and received a third headboard, which was cut wrong and wouldn't fit unless we took a dremel to it (which would void your warranty).  So we contacted them AGAIN.  By this point, we were already in the hospital and had delivered our son (DECEMBER).  They shipped us a new headboard.  The fourth one didn't fit, once again.  At this, we contacted them a final time.  They told us a new, whole crib would be shipped to us and would be to us by Dec 19th, which was when we were to be released from the hospital.  Finally, the second week of January, we contacted Graco as we hadn't had a resolution (or a crib!).  They told us there was unfortunately nothing they could do as they didn't manufacture the crib.  But they would pass on the info to the complaint department.  So we took the crib to Target, who ended up over a 9 day period, contacting several people until Graco customer service decided to send us a new crib NOT manufactured by LaJobi.  The way it sounds, we are not the first, only, or the last to have issues with LaJobi.Word to the wise, if you buy a crib, Graco is normally great- but watch who the manufacturer is- LaJobi is the one to avoid...**********UPDATE TO ORIGINAL REVIEW, POSTED 2-12-10**********The crib we received was another Graco Lauren.  We decided to open it and check it because we'd grown tired of waiting.  The side rail on the new crib had a split part and was splintering.  After fighting with LaJobi, they agreed to take back both cribs and all the headboards on their dime.  They plan on issuing us a refund, which they claim will be here in 4-6 weeks, just in time for us to have a crib when our son turns 4 MONTHS OLD.  All-in-all, horrible experience.

Dark finish, convertible and a price that was unbeatable.The problems began right from the get-go.  After opening the box I discovered that numerous pieces were missing, holes weren't drilled and I had two left back legs instead of a right and a left.  I contacted La Jobi's customer service with my concerns and was told that the missing pieces would be sent overnight.  Instead, I received several packages two weeks later.Assembling the crib was a breeze once I had all of the correct parts and it truly looked wonderful in my daughter's nursery.  From the time she was born until 6 weeks I kept the dropside rail down as she wasn't at risk of moving, but once I did put it in the \"locked\" up position the problems began again.  The left side of the rail would drop when I so much as walked past it - sometimes an inch, sometimes six inches.  I again contacted their customer service department and was sent a repair kit.  I was able to breathe for a week before the rail started to again drop.  I drilled it into place after that.The wood is very flimsy and the finish is a joke.  For the first couple of months I swiffered the crib to clean it but after a projectile vomiting incident I had no choice but to bring out the household cleaners.  I used a bit of Pledge with a microfiber cloth, apparently a magical solution that also washes off the varnish.  Water has the same effect.Once my daughter began teething my hopes of being able to convert the crib to a toddler bed fell by the way side.  With her two front, bottom teeth halfway in the railings and slats were destroyed.  By the time all of her teeth had come in I disassembled the crib and left it at the curb.You truly do get what you pay for in this instance.

I took the chair apart to to take it to Grandma's for Passover Supper and when I went to pick the chair up and move it into the next room it was obvious when the whole bottom section went tumbling that there was an issue so I started looking at it to see what I had done wrong. I put it together and lifted it up over and over and saw that the clip wasn't properly clicked into position. Well how many parents out there aren't quite as attentive to details allowing the little one a hard tumble to the ground face first?

I was sitting and talking with my little guy while he was in the swing and it happened so quickly I could not even intervene.Even though he is under the weight limit for use of the swing, when using it, there was a pretty significant movement of the entire base of the chair.There is also a pretty large gap between the seat and the tray table so my son could not play with his toys on the tray table while sitting in the seat.

When my child first started eating solid foods at 4 1/2 months we weren't able to use the chair because, as other reviewers have stated, it doesn't recline at all.  I had read this in other reviews but didn't really take note of it since I had never had or fed a baby when we bought the chair.  So after a few months of feeding him propped up on a pillow, we were able to start using the chair.  I really didn't mind the wait since the chair has many other points in its favor - the sales woman pointed out to us that, for example, it takes up far less room than a pastic chair since it is more sturdy it can have a much narrower \"stance\" or base.  In our small kitchen, this has been great.  I also LOVE the fact that it has a fixed post between the baby's legs.  I went on vacation and used one that didn't (the post was attached to the tray instead) and my baby just about fell out of that one a million times before I could get the tray up and attached.Now for the bad points:1) The seat has no way to tilt the baby back even slightly.  This was a huge problem when my son started to eat food at 4-5 months since he didn't have great neck control.  So for a few months, I had to feed him propped up on the couch.  But I was a first time mom and didn't even consider that aspect when buying this chair.2) The pads that fit into the back and the bottom of the high chair look great, but they velcro in with pads that stick onto the plastic of the chair and then to the pad.  The velcro might be a good idea, but within a few days the adhesive that sticks the velcro to the plastic of the chair was peeling back (and I didn't abuse it or try to pull it off - it just never stuck very well in the first place).  So now I have loose pads.  The few pieces of velcro that remain attached to the chair get food crumbs stuck in them so when I remove the pads to sweep away loose crumbs these are still encrusted with food.  And trying to scrub them just made them fall off, too.  Really?  For $200+ there should be a better way to keep the pads anchored.  My son drops bits and pieces of everything he is eating down in the seat and it is rather difficult to clean them out of the nooks and crannys unless you remove all the pads every time.  Alternatively, the cheap brand that I borrowed and used on vacation, which had a big puffy pillow pad, could just be brushed off and had no problems with removal and attachment.  Also, there is a crotch strap/buckle that is attached to the post between the child's legs.  That was great and useful when my son was little, but now at 2 he doesn't need it and the strap is so short that the big plastic buckle is always in the way and digs into his leg while eating.  Since this strap is attached to the post, it can't be removed unless you want to permanently cut it off with scissors.  And - this is really important to note - you CAN'T use the tray without the fixed post between the child's legs.  It is either a high chair with a tray or a chair for the adult dining table, no in between because the post between the legs is how the tray attaches.3) Now for the main reason I have given this chair two stars - the STAINS!  I saw one review before I bought this chair that complained about the tray staining.  The chairs manufacturers commented on the review that it was practically unheard of for the tray to stain and so I dismissed the review as just coming from a very dirty person who probably never bothered to clean the tray on a regular basis.  Not so!  Today I fed my son fresh watermelon for the first time.  He played with it for about 1/2 hour while we smiled and took his picture.  Afterwards, I saw that the juice had dried into a surprising yellow/orange color and when I tried to wipe it up it would not budge!  In a panic that my beautiful, expensive high chair was ruined, I ran around trying soap, baking soda (as Oxo recommends) Oxiclean, bleach, comet, lemons, salt, and everything else I had under my sink.  Nothing has even lessened the stains and it cannot be submerged or soaked as many other reviews have noted.  One of the selling points with this chair is that it grows with your child - I am so sad now that I'll have a dirty tray for my son even when he is 5 years old or for any siblings he might have!UPDATE:  I did contact customer service as their representative suggested.  First, I sent an email through the form on their website - more than a week passed with no response so I called.  The rep I spoke with was extremely curt and abrasive - first she said that I must not have sent an email (why would I lie?) and then she acted like she thought I was lying about the stains.  Although she ADMITTED that food like carrots and tomatoes would stain, but didn't believe me that watermelon could.  She said she had some cleaners \"in mind\" that would fix the stains but wouldn't tell me them unless I sent her pictures and THEN she would tell me the names of the cleaners she had in mind.  ARGH!  Do I have time to play games?  Just tell me this \"secret\" cleaner!!!  And not to put too fine a point on it, but I'm virtually Martha Stewart around the house,  I can sew anything, knit anything and whip up food from classic French to traditional Ethiopian while refinishing my own hardwood floors.  I've lived in several European countries that didn't sell a lot of pre-made cleaners so I know bunch of odd formulations that will get just about anything out of anything else.  So having me scan in pictures so she can suggest I try lemons or baking soda again is NOT helpful!!!!Not satisfied.  I usually believe you get what you pay for, but I REALLY wish I had just gotten something at Target or Walmart for half this price since they would have been more user friendly.

This swing lacks head support and seems dangerous.  When my son was 8 weeks old (9lbs) I left him in the swing (buckled in correctly) for 5 minutes while I made lunch.  I went to check on him and I am so thankful that I did.  When I saw him he was extremely pale and sounded like he was sucking air from a straw.  His head had fallen over and he was suffocating. I took him out of the swing immediately and I didn't use it again for months. I did not try the swing again until he was over 5 months old and was able to sit unassisted and had excellent head control. We did not encounter the suffocation issue again but around 8 months old the seams all began ripping on the padding of the seat.  The recommended maximum weight was 30 lbs and my son was only 20lbs at the time.  I called the company and they said they could not send me a new seat but they could replace my swing if I first sent my swing in to them and when they received it they would ship a new one out.  This exchange went well but left me without a swing for 5 days.I received the replacement on April 30th and today on June 8th a ton of the seams have again ripped, leaving the swing unsafe.

Such a terrible design flaw.When they left a gaping hole in the seat of a high chair, one would assume there is an easy and convenient way to clean the inside of it. Wrong. You have to take the entire high chair apart! So, not only am I unable to clean the strap that is used to buckle my son in, food falls through the hole between his legs and sits there. When I notice there was a smell coming from the high chair, I found that I couldn't get to the source without taking the entire high chair apart. 15 screws later, I open up my son's high chair and found maggots living inside of it, feeding off a piece of food that had been pushed down there through the hole where the strap is. What a terrible design feature! If you are going to make a high chair with a hole in the seat, please, geniuses @ ingenuity - where did you hope that food/water/etc would go? Disappear?Anyway, the manufacturer said to keep the chair free of moisture and food debris and make sure to keep it out of warm environments. Haha! Seriously? I live in Florida and we are talking about actual babies here. Babies who think it's fun to shove food in any crevice, babies who are learning to feed themselves, spilling drinks and making messes. It does not matter how clean you keep the outside of the chair if food can fall down INSIDE the high chair and there is no way to clean it without busting out a drill and two different sized screw drivers. This horrible design provides the perfect breeding ground for nasty maggots and flies. Sick. Pictures and videos for proof - sorry, they are gross but everyone should be aware of this!!They said they would give me another high chair, but what good does that do? Give me another nasty high chair that has the same issue? No thanks. In order to receive a refund, I had to cut the seat cover in half, mark X's all over the high chair, send them pictures, and then they will send me a check in the mail for the current retail value.It is SO gross. Every time I look at my son's first birthday pictures of him with his smash cake sitting in a high chair that has maggots inside of it, it infuriates me! Do not buy this chair.

It was convenient, soothed their acid reflux, looked nice in the home, and easily moved from room to room. The height was great - the dogs couldn't get to them and we could easily see them from the couch or bed. We even purchased a mobile to attach to them for their 'personal entertainment'. Labeled as a sleeper, I didn't know that the constant use of this product was actually harming them.At 3 month of age (1 month of use) we began noticing \"flat spots\" on their heads. Their pediatrician examined them, diagnosed them with torticolis (a \"stiff\" neck that prevents an infant from developing full range of motion in the neck), and placed both children in Physical Therapy. After 3 months of Physical Therapy and Repositioning techniques at home, the torticolis improved, but the \"flat spots\" got worse! We were referred to a cranial specialist, and from there were prescribed Helmet Therapy (be aware that most insurances will not cover Helmet Therapy - and each helmet cost approx $2,000).The cranial specialist explained to use that both girls had SEVERE plagiocephaly; so severe that the condition would not correct on its own with time or with repositioning techniques and that a Helmet would be the only solution. He warned of the effects of ignoring the situation: a future of potential migraines, jaw misalignment, vision problems, lazy eyes, ear infections, sinus infection... the list goes on and on.The cranial specialist also questioned if we used a Fisher Price Rock N Play Sleeper. We were stunned we he said he had seen this result from many families after the use of this product. We left flabbergasted, myself in tears.My little girls entered this world fighting for a chance at a normal start to life and I can't help but to think that this product has contributed to their current condition. It is heart crushing that a product I loved so dearly in the beginning, recommending it to every pregnant friend,  turned into a product I'm so disgusted with.As a final note: I've noticed that Fisher Price now offers the Rock N Play with infant head inserts (of course at an increased price)... I'm sure this is their response to this situation, and I'm not sure if it will remedy the effects of a hard board, but I definitely would not use this product without it.

It looks great in our house, and the taupe seat matches very well with our color scheme of gray, beige and blues.  I definitely do not feel that the quality of construction justifies the price (about $260 when we bought it).  The legs, while a nice walnut brown color, are constructed with particle board, and held together with these big visible bolt/screws.  For this price, I would expect real wood, and more subtle placement of screws.  Also, I do not know what I was thinking in purchasing a wood high-chair that was mostly made of plastic.  I wanted a wood chair for the look, and also for ease of clean-up and to keep our baby being exposed to too much plastic.  So although this chair looks nice, I failed on all three intentions.The plastic in this chair is not obnoxious looking, but it does not have the classic look of all-wood.  I fear that the plastic could possibly leach into my baby's food, since I put foods directly on the tray.  And, this chair is most definitely not easy to clean up.  When I was considering this purchase, I remember reading that water can get stuck in the tray during clean-up.  I do not submerge the tray, rather I sponge it off when a scrubby sponge.  Water does sometimes get stuck in there, but I have not noticed any mold growing, and I try to either shake it out or let it dry in an upright position.  Other reviews mentioned staining.  After food has been sitting on it for a while ~ squash, or tomato sauce, it does tend to temporarily stain.  However, I have had good results with scrubbing it off, even after the occasional times when I leave it with food overnight.  The tray does scratch, so be careful with cutting food directly on it.The main thing I do not like about this chair is the seat cushion.  It velcros on so that you can take it off and clean it.  That's a nice idea, but what tends to happen is that food gets stuck under the cushion.  Then when you remove it and try to clean the plastic underneath part, the food gets stuck in the velcro pads on the plastic.  Gross!  Also, for a busy mom, I wish there were not all these little nooks and crevices for food to get stuck in.  I'd like to just wipe it off with a sponge and only rarely take it apart.  But there's this big plastic piece that goes in between your baby's legs, and that makes it difficult to clean all of the food out.  Also, when you take the seat cushion off to clean, you need to be very careful to only get the top part wet because the bottom part is not waterproof and could trap water.There's also a 5-point harness which would be nice for a very squiggly baby, but I never use it.  The straps are not easy to fully clean, and so I'd rather just have them behind my baby.  The bottom part of the harness comes out from the same area as the white plastic piece between the baby's legs.  So if you don't buckle them in, they end on sitting on the buckle, which doesn't seem comfortable.  Obviously the company would want you to buckle your baby every time, but I feel that the leg piece and tray are enough to hold in my baby.  She is not crazy about sitting in the high-chair to begin with, so I will wait to strap her in until she is really moving.Now, I should mention that we do Baby-Led-Weaning.  This means that I put the food on my daughter's tray and let her go to town.  For a mom feeding her child purees, these issues with cleaning may not apply.  But since 3/4 of the food I give my daughter ends up on the seat and floor, they are issues for me.  Other people mentioned this, but I foolishly disregarded it.So in conclusion:  Oxo tot, thanks for creating a nice looking high chair that looks good in my house.  I wish in the future that you would improve the quality of construction, and perhaps create a chair that is entirely made of wood, with cushions that do not come off.  I understand wanting to be able to take them off to clean them, but if they were permanently fixed, I could clean them without worrying about food getting lodged underneath.  Also, please move the bottom harness buckle to under the seat of the chair, so that when not in use, it does not end up underneath my baby's crotch.

No matter how I buckle my son in, the swing tilts horribly to the left and leaves him almost dangling out, and rotated onto his side/stomach. My husband tightened the screws and put it in the most upright position. I thought if I put the tray on it would help, but no, he was still almost falling out the left side. I have tried swaddling and putting the buckles through the slit in the swaddle back and that has not helped either. I have spoken to other parents who have expressed the same issue.

They do not pop into place like regular Hugh chair straps the have a c hook which is difficult to use and could potentially pinch the baby. I thought ok I'll just leave them in place and hook his arms through like a cat seat. I strap him in and he barely fits. He is 18lbs and 27in tall. I out the tray on and he has hardly any room for his legs. Sticking my fingers under it I notice sharp edges. Why? Had I reaclined him those edges would be digging into his legs.Installing it on a chair was difficult. For one it is longer than a normal dinner chair so part of the base hangs off the chair. I went to snap the straps around the chair and they popped off! (Also the straps on the seat where put in backwards out of the box and those hard to be fixed.)

The day it arrived on my doorstep-it looked like someone had already opened the package & resealed it shut. I had my husband carefully open and inspect each piece for flaws. After he set it up I did end up finding a ding in the front of the crib that looked like a flaw in the wood-kind of like a knot? Nothing that was caused by anyone just a flaw in the wood itself. I decided I would keep it due to the price & I did not want to have to pay the RESTOCKING fee. (Please read all the fine print before you buy this crib-there are certain specifications that will allow you to return it, but it is very specific)Now, onto the part that has really set me back... My bedding. I purchased a high quality bedding that is very generic in make. The two huge issues I have, and that you really cannot see in the pictures are: 1) All bumpers come with ties for 4 sides of rails, not 3 unless you have it made specifically. Also, the ends of the cribs do no match where the bumper ties should go so it pulls the bumper too tight in the front. In the back, I could barely fit the cloth in between the rails to secure the back/side of the bumper. I hope this makes sense. See the picture that customer posted of her bed, and you can tell she had to pull, and maneuver the ties to get them to secure. Also the back wooden piece of the crib does not have a place to secure the bumper so this makes it a definite safety hazard. 2) The hinges that hold the metal mattress holder is at an angle like this:\\____/ This angle makes your bed skirt gather up, and not lay correctly. Also see the pictures posted above-It will make your bedskirt shorter than it should on the ends.This was really frusterating to me. I love my bedding more than the crib especially at this point, and almost to the point of just buying a new crib if I can. I won't be purchasing anymore of this brand of furniture.

My son is now 16 months old so we've been using it for just under a year now.Pros:- This chair is very sturdy and very well built.- Assembly is fair easy.- It's fairly attractive.- It's a good size and seems it would grow well with my son.- Tray is easy to clean- WarrantyCons:- The cushions have a felt like material on the back. Food gets stuck on the back and is not simple to clean (You can't just wipe it off).- The cushions attach by velcro. My son pulls the cushions off the back and sides and food ends up behind them on to the hard to clean felt like stuff.- The velcro collects food and is very difficult to keep clean.- Food easily collects around the bottom of the center column that is between the kid's legs. This is because the center is removable so it can be a still be used when your kid gets older. The angles there are tight so be vigilant to keep it clean.- When cleaning (lateral motions applied) the chair can squeak as plastic rubs together. I can probably fix this by further tightening bolts (they are not really loose) but it's not a big deal to me so I haven't tried to fix that part.- The biggest fault I've found is with the design of the tray. While it is easy to clean you must take great care in cleaning it! Never let water run directly over it (especially not directly over the handle), and never let any side of it become submerged. If you do, water can get inside it and while it has two little drain holes (and water can drain out of the handle although not necessarily by design) once you've gotten water inside, it's over! Also it is somewhat difficult to get all the water to drain. It gets trapped in little places inside. The problem is that there are two springs inside that are used in attaching the tray to the chair. When the handle is squeezed, the springs are collapsed retracting two plastic rods. When the handle is released, the springs expand pushing the two rods out to secure the tray to the chair. The springs are pretty slim metal and once they get wet, they begin to rust and break down. Over time, twists of the spring start to break off and the tray no longer properly secures to the chair allowing your kid to push the tray and everything on it off into the floor. Also, I noticed some mold growing inside mine, so be careful! Don't let water get inside!Additional:I contacted customer support about the tray and they are fairly responsive. You have to contact them through the contact form on the website. They generally respond in 1-2 days and they did honor my 7-year warranty. It took about 7-10 business days for the new tray to arrive after they shipped it so they must select the most cost-effective shipping.Overall:Overall this is a decent high chair that will probably last through a couple of kids (minus tray). I know the cons section is much longer but I feel I must explain in more detail any gripes I have. I think I much prefer  shellac'd wood to the cushions and plastic for cleaning / durability of the high chair part. The tray having a place where moisture can collect is my biggest complaint. Everything is is relatively minor unless you're a germ-a-phobe and must have everything spic-and-span. If that is the case, beware of the felt-like seat-back and velcro that collects food and other stuff.", "review_id": "RBKRAQRUOSU0W", "asin": "B01644POHE", "proba": "99.99%", "product_name": "OXO Tot Sprout High Chair, Gray/White"}, {"id": 119, "title": "Save your money buy another kind", "review": "Really bad bouncer.

They were very helpful and we ended up picking the Bright Starts Comfort & Harmony.  The Bright Starts seat has no chance of having the same issue as the Carter's seat.

If I had to stop suddenly by putting both feet down, I'd fall into the small space between the iBert seat and my own bike seat and it hurt.  My son, on the other hand, LOVED it.

I had a rear child seat with our older son and it felt a lot more fun and interactive to have him in front.Fast forward to this spring when I put my now 2 1/2 year old in the seat for the first time after the snow melted.  He'd gotten heavier (~35 lbs.), pushing the 38 lb. weight limit on the seat, and it was harder to control my front wheel with him attached.

We took them on a handful - maybe 4? - international trips, and always pulled the children through airports on them while they rode on top. I understand what people say about the wheels not turning making them hard to pull, but my husband and I never found that to be a problem.  They turned well enough for us to use. Never a problem with any aspect of construction, fits under the seat, holds toys, a change of clothes, jammies and a jacket - perfect for a carryon. Then on our most recent trip, my now-4 year old son, who weighs 40 pounds, rode on his trunki as he always does. My husband noticed it was hard to pull. We investigated when we got home and found that one of the front wheels had melted and fused to the case - apparently it began rubbing at some point and the friction caused the plastic to melt and fuse when it cooled. Since he's well under the weight limit and they've been great until now, we thought it was just a fluke and when another trip came up we ordered him this updated model. He's still 40 pounds. We pulled him while riding from security to our gate, and upon arrival at our destination found the same problem - a front wheel is jammed into the case and with any more use, I'm sure it will fuse, too. He couldn't pull it up the road to our hotel, so we had to carry yet another case when we were counting on towing it (for the record - we only pull the kids in airports - never on a rough surface like a road, although we do pull the case without rider on sidewalks, etc, while traveling and they're not allowed to use them as toys, so they haven't had a chance to treat them 'badly'). We're so disappointed, both because they've been such a great product for us until the last 2 trips and the kids absolutely love them - my son will be heartbroken that we won't be pulling him on the return trip.

Even while we were assembling them, it didn't seem that everything was lining up properly and with the reasonable ease that would be expected with something that costs this much.  My belief is that even though the individual pieces are made of solid wood, the way in which they have been cut with rounded edges does not allow for solid and stiff connections between the components.  Screws should not be the only things holding the chair together.  Well fitted joints are also the key to solid construction.

Overall it is a very functional chair but there are a couple minor flaws and then one MAJOR design flaw.First, the cushions can only be wiped down with a wet cloth and the bottom side can't even get wet because it is an absorbent type material.Second, the velcro which is supposed to hold the seat cushion in place stops working properly after a few months and it is because of that fabric I mentioned on the bottom of the cushion.Lastly, the biggest and MAJOR problem with this chair is the tray design. It is constructed of two halves that screw together with a dozen screws and even if you run a little water on this tray to assist in washing it off, the water gets inside the tray and is near impossible to get out. I took it apart once because I could see pink mildew forming around the parting line. Luckily the first time that is all it was. The second time though was tonight before I wrote this review. I took the trays apart and I was in disbelief. There was pink mildew all over the inside of the tray and even food particles that had gotten in. It was absolutely disgusting and makes me furious. I had to completely take apart the tray (there are four other pieces inside the tray that have white grease all over them) and scrub in ever crevice.

They said if it was a defect I needed to call the company. so i called the company to see if swinging too fast was a common problem. They said, it appeared to be be going so fast because there was no weight in it. So i took a 20lb. dumbell and it still swang way too fast, but now with the weight it was going to tip over! Soooo I called the company back again. They said that we could ship it back (at our expense) and they would look at it and issue a credit if they felt it was a true defect.

It has several serious design flaws, most of which cause pain. As my average-sized son has grown, it has gotten increasingly uncomfortable for him to sit in, and we are getting rid of it.here are the flaws of this chair:1: Seat base. At the rear of the seat base, at the back edge, there's a terrible corrugated section. My son pointed at this part of the seat, told me it was uncomfortable, I looked under the truly thin padding and found a ridged, corrugated pain inducing area. See the first pic.2: Seat top. There's a thin sharp ridge at the apex of the seat back. See the second pic. If my son looks straight up, his head hits this ridge. He looked up this morning, now he has a welt on the back of his head. This chair is getting thrown out asap.3: Feet. The legs are quite splayed, fine, stability is not a problem. However, my toes suffered a ton when they got stubbed into the feet on this chair, which stick out when they could easily point inwards.4: Tray. It isn't level. This is amusing once, but every time since when I put a bowl or fork or cup or anything, it slides. It's really annoying and cannot be adjusted.5: Recessed cup area. It does not accommodate a handled mug or sippy cup. This is ridiculous.6: Tray. This thing is bigger than a skateboard! and almost as heavy! Cleaning it, even just removing it to get kiddo out of the seat, requires a huge landing spot to place it on.7: Wheel locks. These don't work. The wheels are plastic and allow the chair to slide on a tile or wooden floor. This means that in order to get the kid out of the chair you have to put your foot on the crossbar. If you don't, as you lift the kid the chair slides backwards, pinching the child's legs between the seat and the snack tray. Holy smokes is this a bad design, and could seriously hurt a child. I'm surprised there hasn't been a recall.In summary, don't get this high chair. The cover may be easy to clean, but that's the chair's only selling point.

Normally his head would come down and bonk the floor mildly. However, his head came down right where those \"mounds\" are on the sliders and he came up with a very deep puncture wound.

At his 4 month check up my pediatrician referred me to a plastic surgeon for a consolation. The plastic surgeon prescribed my son to wear an orthotic helmet for 4 months to reshape his head. I was very upset with the diagnosis and inspected the sleeper when I got home. The product has a hard spot where the baby's head lies. I had to cut my poor baby's hair off because it was too hot and uncomfortable in the helmet. I am very upset and looking to do a class action law suit. Did anyone else have this problem?

I checked the lights on top, and yes, I did have the swing set to the highest level -- music still works, mobile still works. Just the motor that actually moves the swing.  I guess I should feel lucky that we got about 6 months out of it. If you read the reviews on Fisher Price's website, the average time before the motor fails is about 3 months.  I tried to get a replacement motor, and *shocker* -- the motor housing is on backorder through mid-April -- looks like quite a few people have this issue right now - they can't even keep it stocked.  When the swing worked, it was great. The fact that it no longer works, irks me, as this isn't a cheap item. Most of us purchase big ticket items knowing that we'll be able to use these with future kids, or be able to re-sell the item.  The fact that they keep selling this unit, knowing that there is a motor issue, is upsetting.  I have no idea how long the swing had been stopped when I went to get my daughter.

I do like the actual crib and the style--so many cribs these days are boxy and minimalist, and I wanted something with a little more style. My experience with this company, however, has left me severely disappointed and wishing I had not purchased this crib.Before I get into my issues with the manufacturer and the shipping (I'm only commenting on shipping since it seems to have affected many other customers, too, so it's relevant)...putting this together was only mildly frustrating. I wish the pieces were labeled, but if you've ever put together Ikea or the like, you'll be fine. I got a standard Lullaby Earth mattress and it fits well in this, snug fit (which is good of course).Now, on to my problems with this crib. When my husband and I opened the crib, we noticed the severe damage to one of the centerpieces of the whole thing--the little arch that goes over the headboard (see photos). The holes in the wood corresponded to holes in the outer packaging, so clearly Million Dollar Baby (manufacturer) doesn't pad their products enough. It was unusuable in that condition, so I called the number on the warranty card. An actual person answered, and after getting the model, lot, and part number, she shipped us out a new arch. It arrived about a week later, from California. It arrived undamaged.So we started putting the crib together once again, only to see that the headboard had a pretty noticeable scratch/dent. It wasn't nearly as bad as the original damage (which is why we hadn't noticed it the first time), but we felt we shouldn't have to \"live with it\" on a brand new crib, especially since the headboard is the focal point. So once again, I had to call Million Dollar Baby and order a replacement. Meanwhile, our baby's crib was in pieces in the nursery and we couldn't move forward with other projects until it was done!The SECOND replacement finally arrived...and imagine our shock when we opened it to find even worse damage than the part we were replacing it with! See photos. At this point, it had been almost a month since opening it that we were unable to put it together. I'm due in almost a month, so we didn't have the option of ordering ANOTHER replacement--especially since, as we learned, the replacement piece could be worse than the original! So we put it together hoping that the scratch wouldn't be noticeable.Needless to say, I'm disgusted with Million Dollar Baby and wish I had spent more money on a better crib. I like the look of this crib a lot and liked that, while it was soft wood just like the ones from Pottery Barn Kids, it was much cheaper. But you get what you pay for, I guess.I will say that the lady I spoke to on the phone was very friendly and efficient and when I wrote a lengthy email to the manufacturer after this whole ordeal, someone wrote back. But they said they couldn't give me a refund or a discount because I bought the crib from Amazon, and just offered to send me another headboard--yeah, like I'm going to take apart the entire crib after all this--or a furniture pen to hide the knicks and dents. The representative even blamed UPS/FedEx and basically said they toss items around so it's not the manufacturer's fault that things get damaged. I've ordered quite a few baby products in the past few months, and not a single thing has arrived damaged. This includes a dresser of similar material...it arrived just fine. Clearly, it's the way the company packages the products. At any rate, they should stand behind their products and give me some sort of discount. Because right now, I paid full price for a crib that looks second-hand. It has a scratch on the headboard and several little knicks on other pieces that we'll have to cover with paint (going to have to take one of the broken pieces to a paint store and have the paint matched). Hopefully no one but us will ever notice, but it's really sad to have my baby's crib look used before she's even born. And this whole process has been stressful for me being 7-8 months pregnant and dealing with all this back and forth.Just understand that if you get this crib, it almost certainly will arrive damaged. So don't cut it too close to your baby's due date. And if you expect a brand new crib to look brand new when it arrives, just be prepared to have to call the manufacturer at least once and order replacement parts. Otherwise, look elsewhere--honestly I should have just gotten a floor model at one of the baby stores if I was going to have chips, scratches, etc.--could have gotten a better quality crib for the same price, probably. Even though the PBK cribs are overpriced, I feel like they would at least package them correctly so they'd arrive safely.

This may not matter or be significant to many. it has reviews. i'd look at all reviews in the last 6-12 months however. I don't think it is 'unsafe', but I was more worried about the older stages when babies like to climb or wiggle the crib. OURS was unsafe, but that happens on the manufacture line and nothing is perfect all the time. Some things I'd like to warn you about, or make you aware of are:  Watch for a gap between frame and sides (ours had almost 2 inches between), or it not lining up. Ours had that strange issue where  one size was slightly longer than the others, and the holes were missing on one side (that was the short side on your right). Holes  were not proper distance from end to end if measuring from the base to the holes. I thought I put it together wrong, but hubby  agreed. We took a measuring tape and just stared in awe. Must be a manufacture error for sure. Box was a little worn when we got  it, so I have no idea. You'll notice looking down at it that the sides are just zig zagged wrong if you had the same issue I did. ***Also NO RAIL was listed on the box as of 2016***unless you get the older box in other colors possibly, or one still left over. I also had hole issues-as in-they were not present when you go to put the last long side on. Yup after all that building, lol. This type of thing happens, but we decided to take our refund and go with the cosco white crib. Search amazon for : Cosco Applegate Metal Crib, White listed for $99 bucks and arrived faster and felt more sturdy, faster to put together, and one person can do it. That crib is metal (may feel cool to touch) and does not convert to a toddler bed-so there is a down side. I liked how sturdy it felt so I went with that. After a year or so, I'd just move child to a twin bed though. New toddler sized beds are great, but so are used or second-hand so pick whatever works for you. See if a local store carries this and feel it for yourself, and look at all recent reviews in the last year. Maybe its a change in quality, or maybe just a fluke. This crib had one more notch to lower bed as child ages, and it converts when you BUY the rail separately. I prefer the cosco one because it is more sturdy. And it's slightly cheaper.OLD REVIEW:It took three weeks to get (listed at time as 2-3 days), and the side rails were missing the aligning holes after I was down to one last side. As in they were not drilled. Instructions tell you not to drill into it either. We'd have to drill 3-4 holes as child grew to accommodate child's bed to go lower. With the flimsy material I didn't feel comfortable doing this, nor did I want to break it and void warranty. It also seemed very bendable and not really wood like, and more like plastic. I guess it would be OK, but not for me. Before assembly check your smaller ends and make sure both have holes on the outter, inner and sides. the sides should look identical. Also, upon putting the first three edges together, it was not flush where it came together leaving a 2 inch to 3 inch gap from the short end to back to short end. I almost wish I had a picture before we dissembled. I had all hardware, the item was packed good, and instructions did come with it.I was unhappy with customer service.This typically doesn't happen but I figured I'd explain. I asked the girl several times to speak up and she wouldn't change her tone. She asked for information several times and didn't get it right. That may be a mic issue, but she never asked me to speak up, slower or anything. She did offer to have a partial refund to have someone fix it. I thought that was weird (warranty issues and what if it broke?), but may have been due to the shipping return cost. Still, I didn't think it was a good idea for her to offer me.I am trying to be positive in my thoughts, she may not have known. She also said I could drill into it-and I told her that it says not to use certain tools like drills on it. I don't know, I was just even more irritated by all of this even more so than when I started.That said, I went with a refund, and UPS will do a pickup. I was happy with that resolution, but now I have to start all over and I have no way to get a crib from a store to my house. This item was on sale, and I used a gift card for it, and liked it could be shipped. I can't just run to a nearby store now to get a crib. I have a gift card to amazon...not something I can go run and get. That's my problem I suppose, but I won't chance buying something else and having a similar issue, and I am not waiting another three weeks for a 'big box' as it was put.

The lily pad is completely fuzzed out now and the fluff can easily be pulled off. I am wondering what to do about it or how to make it safe for her again.Has this happened to anyone else? I want to give this seat 4 stars because it is a good product for the most part and has been good for our family and mostly easy to use.I want to give it no stars for the lily pad material choice. And I want to give 2 stars for the metal locks on the legs. They are a bit hard to manage. Other than those two things I like this seat very much!I guess I'll go with a 2 star rating for now!I have contacted the company about the lily pad.

However, this crib hardly seems sturdy enough to hold any adventurous baby!  Mine doesn't climb out or bounce around much in his crib, but it almost seems like this would have fallen apart if he had!My biggest complaint about this crib was that there is a big gap between the mattress and the side rail.  I'd say about 3 inches?  From what I understand, a crib mattress should fit very snug against all sides of the crib to prevent entrapment.  This crib does not meet that standard!I did use this crib from the time my son was 4 months until he turned 3, and we didn't have any issues.  But like I said, any baby more adventurous than mine might have more issues with this bed.By the way, some have mentioned the recall for this crib--I wouldn't be too overly concerned about it.  ALL cribs that have drop sides have been issued recalls.  I don't know if the newest versions of this crib still have a drop side, but new cribs are supposed to be being made without drop sides from this point on.  I just say, enjoy the drop side while it lasts!

And they do enjoy riding in it. There are two major drawbacks that keep us from giving it a higher rating, however. They could be fixed rather simply, I think--and possibly even yourself if you wanted--but it points to a design flaw in my opinion. The first drawback is the interference of the leg wells, with your pedaling. This can be quite annoying, since the plastic leg wells hit the back of your foot, and stick out from the frame. This could be easily corrected by adjustable straps or clips that would pin the leg wells onto the bike frame, protecting your child from the wheel, and protecting your leg from hitting them. Secondly, when we strapped our kids in, and biked around and over speed bumps or other unevenness, there was often a disconcerting, loud plastic \"snap\" sound that came from the seat. On inspection, we found that this was coming from the underside of the seat, beneath where the red buckle clip attaches. A plastic tab snaps against the part that mounts onto the bike platform. It happens when the seat flexes when you hit bumps, but it does not appear to be a safety issue, as the seat is securely bolted. However, it is very disconcerting to both the rider and the child--our daughter was freaking out when she heard it. I'm not sure the best way to fix that, but the manufacturer should definitely look into it.Now, aside from those two problems, the seat does seem stable, comfortable, and simple to adjust. The mounting system, once installed, is quick and easy to mount and dismount, and the platform could even be used to mount a small trunk bag, when the child seat is not attached--though it doesn't seem designed for that purpose. It would have been nice to have a little different buckle design, when a child is wearing a helmet, it can be a little awkward getting the belt on--maybe a side clip would be easier. It is definitely usable for an easy going ride, and gives the opportunity for enjoyment with you and your child.

After writing this review, they made many attempts to contact me to come to a solution.  Due to my schedule, I was never able to speak with them directly.  Letters and phone calls were made to me and the part that I initially complained about was sent to me without asking.  Very few companies are as diligent as Abiie and committed to customer satisfaction.  I do commend them on this.  That being said, I still can't recommend the chair as a long term solution.  The footrest on the chair, which eventually becomes the \"seat\" has now buckled and split.  Babies are messy and after regular spills and cleanings, the finish is almost gone in several spots and the seat will be unable to be used as a transitional piece as marketed.  It is very disappointing.  It is an attractive chair, but don't expect it to last beyond the first year.When we first purchased this item, it seemed promising and in the photographs, it looks great.  Upon arrival, it becomes apparent this is a highly marked up 'made in china' type item. Cheap and disposable, and at a list price of $249.00 - that's a joke. As a woodworker, I can tell you for certainty, this item is nowhere in the ballpark of a $200.00 chair and the \"You Save\" price is just there to make you feel like you're getting a deal.  You're not.After 6 months of use, its 'made in china' quality is becoming apparent.  The bolts need to be re-tightened regularly, making the chair wobbly and unsafe with use, the finish and stain wears off easily from use and cleaning.  The \"high quality european beechwood\" I can only assume is just the supports,  the rest is cheap plywood with cheap finish on it that easily rubs off, exposing bare wood below.  The cutouts in the plywood seat for the 'seat belt' are left unsanded and unfinished, and are impossible to clean. Additionally, on the plywood ends, there are several places where the plywood was never sealed up.The bottom support between the legs is too thin, and has already split in two on ours, compromising its stability left to right.The plastic clips which are used to slide the seat and foot stool in and out are not sealed to the wood, so they easily collect food and moisture and you cannot clean under them without a screwdriver.  The seat material gets dirty easily and because of its texture, has to be scrubbed (can't be machine washed supposedly) clean, absorbs water, and takes a while to dry out.The only reason I don't give it 1 star is because it can be adjusted and (if it lasts) may be a chair one day for our son.  But with the split wood and finish wearing off after 6 months use, I don't have high hopes that it will see much use as a chair like shown in the photos.  If you want a cheaply made wooden high chair, go for it, but perhaps choose the non-stained version so you won't see the finish wearing off so easily.  Otherwise, for the same price, get a name-brand plastic type high chair that you can hand down, re-use on additional children, or re-sell.

We found this out the hard way (fortunately baby was not in her seat at the time) when the car seat is locked in place in the stroller, if you twist the handle to fold, the stroller will collapse and the car seat will fly backwards and off the stroller.  We had the stroller and car seat set up in our living room and my 5 year old daughter walked up and twisted the handle and we were shocked by what happened. It would never have occurred to me to test this, but now that I saw what could happen it was very upsetting.  It seems like a big safety flaw to me.  I would assume that the stroller would not be capable of collapsing down while the car seat is snapped into place.While I understand that if the seat and stroller are not compatible this might happen, but that was not the case, as both seat and stroller are the graco system and even the same Kyte pattern, obviously made to go together.

The swing worked for about 6-7 weeks before the motor started acting up.  While it was working it was great (though upon later comparison it did swing very fast which may have been due to the bad motor) when one night it started to make horrible, loud  noises.  The next day the noises were gone but it was swinging very slowly at the highest settings and the auto-stop feature would kick in constantly, stopping the motor for a few seconds then starting back up again.  This then became a cycle, every couple of days it would get really loud then it would be quite but not function properly.  After a week of this I called Graco and was told that they could send a replacement motor but the part was on back order for 6-8 weeks.  OK, so that was not a viable option as I was sleep training my reflux and protein sensitive baby using the swing so I asked about exchanging the swing and was told I could exchange the swing by packing it up and mailing it to Graco who would then send a replacement in 4-6 weeks.  Still too long, what about a refund?  For a refund I could pack up the swing send it to Graco and upon receipt of the swing they would issue a refund in 6-8 weeks.

This is the fourth, yes fourth Fisher-Price cradle swing I have owned.  The first one was from thirteen years ago and had just three speeds and no fancy bells or whistles like sounds or motorized mobile.  It was basic and it was great.  I used it for my first two children and then passed it on to a friend who used it for her baby.  The second one was a papasan swing that I brought second hand at a yard sale for our third child.  The swing had already gone through two children and was used briefly for my third baby and then passed on to another friend who got a ton of use out of it and passed it back to me for my nephew.  The third swing, and the one I like best is the aquarium swing that a friend gave us for our third baby.  I prefer that one because it has an a/c adaptor and has the same excellent construction as our original cradle swing.  Now let's move on to the review of this Rainforest Friends swing.I was really excited when I found out I was going to have the opportunity to review this swing.  It has neutral colors, much like the papasan swing I had picked up at a yard sale, which meant it would blend in perfectly with my living room and family room decor, and best of all it had an a/c adaptor so I wouldn't have to worry about keeping a steady supply of batteries on hand.  But my excitement faded away when I started to assemble the swing.Assembly for this swing is a major pain in the rear.  I have assembled three previous models of Fisher-Price cradle swings with relative ease. They all snapped and screwed together in roughly five to ten minutes with zero frustration.  This swing, however was a nightmare to assemble.  I had to fight with it to get the legs screwed together and then the real struggle came when it was time to attach the seat to the motor.  The old design with a nut and bolt was preferable to the new design that has the nut encased in a plastic collar that is not easy to align with the bolt.  Both my husband and I had to do a fair amount of fighting with the connection points before we could get the swing fully assembled.  If I only had to assemble this swing once, I might not be so annoyed about the assembly, but this \"fun\" was to be repeated not once, not twice, but FOUR times.  Why so many you ask?  Well, motor number one, the one included with the original swing had a defect where it would swing for about ninety seconds, stop and then the motor would grind for about thirty seconds and start swinging again.  I called customer service and they were very helpful and offered to send out a replacement motor. Several days later the new motor arrived poorly packaged in a badly banged up box.  Only after I had the swing reassembled did I realize that the control panel was cracked.  Awesome.  But I decided to run the swing and test out the motor so I could write this review.  This motor had pretty much the same problem as the first one but would swing for about ten mintues before it stopped and started grinding.  So I called customer serivce again and explained my problem and offered to send this motor back with the original one that they wanted back.  A second replacement was then sent out (motor number 3).  This one arrived several days later.  It was very dirty and covered in scratches.  Once I had it together I turned it on and was surprised that the motor was good.  Then I noticed that the mobile had lots of white grease oozing out of it.  Just what you want hanging over your baby, right?  So I had to call customer service again.  This time the rep I spoke to decided that she needed to escalate my call to a different department because she felt that it was pretty bad that three motors in a row had issues and she wanted to make sure that the issue got addressed.  They confirmed that grease shouldn't be all over the outside of the motor housing and asked me to package that one up so they could send UPS to pick it up.  A third replacement motor was then sent with expedited shipping.  This motor, like the two before it came scratched up and dirty, but it works and there's no grease leaking from it.  It does, however have a really bad ridge of metal in the tubing that connects to the leg that makes getting the leg on or off a task that requires two to three people.  It took two of us to put the leg on and three of us to pull it off (one to pull on the motor housing, one to pull on the leg and another to depress the little button that holds the two pieces together).  I don't know about you, but I don't have time for that level of nonsense.Now that we got past the assembly and motor quality issues, let's look at the rest of the swing's features.  The overall construction seems very flimsy when compared to previous Fisher-Price cradle swings.  The swing motor is a bit loud, but every cradle swing we've had from Fisher-Price has been a bit loud so I wouldn't hold the noise against it.  The legs on this swing concern me.  It looks like the new design serves the function of requiring Fisher-Price to use less steel to construct the swing and results in a less secure base for the swing.  As the swing swings, the legs walk themselves in towards each other.  It's a gradual walk, but the more the legs come together, the less stable the swing becomes.The music for the swing is ok.  It's not overly annoying but it's not something I'd forsee using in my house. I found the nature sounds to be better than the music.  The mobile is cute and the little animals and leaves move up and down as the mobile rotates so that will add interest for the babies.  I really dislike the mirrored dome.  It will give baby a distorted view of him/herself.  I much perfer the dome like the one on the aquarium swing to this one.The seat pad isn't anything spectacular.  The head rest can be moved up and down to accomodate babies of differing heights, but it's pretty thin and isn't going to help prevent flat spots on baby's head.  I'd rather this seat pad didn't have the head rest so a head rest like the Boppy Noggin Nest could be used instead.  The seat pad is gender neutral.  I prefer gender neutral baby gear so you don't find yourself swimming in say all pink baby gear from your first baby only to have to go out and buy all new stuff if you have a boy next.So the bottom line on this swing is I'd stay away from it.  It's not the best construction and if my experience with three bad swing motors makes me think they have some issues that need to be addressed.  I'd suggest looking at different models of Fisher-Price swings instead.  Look for the ones that have a different style leg.", "review_id": "R3RKBCHRBHJ0T0", "asin": "B00B9ZRYZY", "proba": "99.69%", "product_name": "Fisher-Price Deluxe Cradle 'n Swing, Rainforest Friends"}, {"id": 247, "title": "Caveat emptor.

My son is three and now out of the chair, but my 1-year old has been using it.  However, despite the fact that the chair is still perfectly \"functional,\" I'm considering replacing it.  Why?To begin, the cushions are very difficult to keep clean.  Even when you wipe them down, food gets stuck in crevices.  Food is always getting trapped under the cushion and going unnoticed, and the velcro is disgusting.  Ugh. Even with daily cleaning the chair stinks.  Recently, I was scrubbing a particularly troublesome spot and the plastic brown covering started peeling off.  But below is why I'm not going to bother buying a replacement for $50....The tray.  Oh, the tray.  I've always noticed that if you don't scrub the area under the arms of the tray regularly they can accumulate what can only be described as mold.  It is actually a very difficult area to get too and I've only managed it with a bottle brush. Well, recently I've noticed how the edges where the plastic meets seem dirty (oh, you didn't know?  It's not one smooth piece of plastic.  It's several different pieces of plastic screwed together, and water can collect inside the tray after cleaning).  I decided to take it apart to give it a good (long overdue) cleaning inside and out.  I can't say I was completely surprised to see the inside of the tray literally covered with the same black stuff that can accumulate under the arms.  But now having seen it, I don't think I can ignore the fact that this tray is unsanitary any longer.  No way is it good for my child to have his food in such close proximity to what has to be mold.I would not recommend this chair to anyone.

The dark spot in the middle is actually highly porous (looks like gas bubbles were entrapped or formed during the casting process), which compromised its strength--- it's highly unlikely that this was the only bad bar they ever shipped, and there's no surface inspection that will prove that another is OK.I wrote to the company the day this happened to send them pictures and suggest that they redesign the bar from a stronger (or more carefully controlled/inspected) material, but over three months later they have still taken no action.

When my son started baby food I still liked it, but when when the real use of a high chair came in question then this chair failed because:1: there is no way to truly clean the tray- you can't put it under running water caus it will get inside the tray and grow mold!! I'm very detailed with cleaning and mine still grew mold in creases.2: tray is very heavy ( I'm 5'11\" and very fit and still think it's heavy).3- the seat cushion grows mold :( it's so sad cause I did take the time to spot clean after each use and deep clean it every 3 days and put outside in the hot Florida sun.... And still!!!! Mold on bottom!!! After all that!!4- forget about the Velcro that keeps the seat in place cause food will get in it and believe me it won't come out. So disgusting that you will peel it out as well.5- THE FOOT REST IS POORLY DESIGNED!!! The baby and toddler foot will never rest causing the weight to be supported on the back of their knees! I went from all positions and because of the angle they designed the chair ( the seat is too forward) the foot will never reach! My son is 93 percentale high and still won't reach!6- the chair is SUPER HEAVY!

The white part of the seat was dingy and the paint on the metal parts was chipped in several spots. The packaging had been opened and retaped shut. All hardware was present, but was floating loose inside the packaging. It came with a screwdriver and little wrench for assembly. I had ordered this product to use on a family bike ride this weekend, so I chose not to return the used product since I know I cannot find a local replacement before the weekend.The seat attached quickly to my bike seat post with 4 screws and nuts. There is also a spring to pivot the mounting hardware 90* so it could be mounted on a center crossbar instead if that is the style of your bike. The seat the child sits on has several screw holes that can adjust where the seat sits on the bar bringing child closer or farther from the parent. Once installed, the product is very secure where the mounting hardware connects, but the joint allowing the hardware to rotate bends down slightly under weight. For my daughter, it still feels secure even after she's sitting on it.Riding with it on is great. My daughter loves it. She points things out and chats my ear off the entire bike ride. Parents legs do bow slightly out as you pedal, but I think that is inevitable with this type of child seat. There are no foot pegs for child, which was OK, but my daughter kept saying, \"mom, you bonking my legs\" I plan on attaching some cording hanging down from either side of the handle bars creating stirrups her feet can rest in. I had given up riding with her because she would unbuckle herself from the bike trailer and stand up or poke her head out the flap, and she is still too small to ride on her own.Overall I am pleased with the product.

The way the brackets mount to the corner posts prevent some mattresses from fitting snugly into the frame, creating either dangerous corner gaps and/or causing the mattress to no rest level on the spring frame. If your mattress has rounded, reinforced corners, it will likely not fit this crib. After purchasing and returning two mattresses that didn't fit in this crib, I finally found one that did. The Sealy Soybean Foam-Core Crib Mattress was the mattress that finally fit! Probably because of the square corners and the fact that's it's solid foam, instead of a coil construction.Still, the frustration level was unnecessary and I would not recommend this crib, unless you are doing your homework and purchase a mattress that is known to fit this model. DaVinci should really look into fixing this issue, or provide a list of approved mattresses that will fit their cribs.As for the quality of the crib, it's good. Easy to put together and the quality is good for the price.

I wanted to love it!  But it's just all wrong; on many levels. I read the lower rating reviews before purchasing. And thought that people are too picky, nothing's perfect! I should have listened to their warnings. Because there is a clear theme of issues among the lower ratings. I did not purchase this from Amazon. I bought two gently used and purchased the infant insert and trays new, direct from Keekaroo. However, like most people, I hardly buy anything these days without consulting Amazon reviews.First and biggest issue, cleaning. The infant insert is horrific!  It is so poorly designed I'm baffled how it made it from design room to production. It is attached via an extra belt/tether system and velcro. The tethering wraps around the wood seat and loops up and through the two back lap belt holes in the infant insert. Basically, it's a boat load of additional strap material for food to get on and under, every single meal. Then there's the velcro... I'm guessing its main function is to keep the infant insert in place towards the front. Per Keekaro instructions, you lift the front part of the insert to clean underneath. Resulting in: 1) your child seeing this and then repeating 2) you're trying to clean underneath the insert - which is not easy, you can BARELY get your hand in there - whatever rag/dishcloth/paper towel gets snagged in the velcro including food. Fun. Next, there are three large holes in the infant insert that allow the seat straps to thread through. All three are perfectly positioned to allow all manner of food and spills to fall down into the under side of infant insert, that I described above. Thus leaving you to: clean all the straps, lift the insert up, cram your hand underneath, chase food all around (which you have to push onto the floor because your other hand is holding the insert up) and snag or tear whatever cleaning product you're using in the process. Frankly it is a deal breaker when there are three meals a day, every day.Second, it's weight. Yes it is wood. But it is heavy and cumbersome to move. It's scratching my hardwood floors. And the round holes on the seat back are in no way designed for use in lifting. On top of the fact that my babies are into pushing anything that isn't nailed down around. I worry that one day they'd topple one onto themselves.Third, the belt buckles. 9/10 times it requires multiple tries to get both belts to come off.Fourth, the tray. It is near impossible to remove with one hand while holding a kid. It requires about four maneuvers to squeeze the latch triggers on each side to get it out. The additional locking mechanisms \"lock\" into place all the time. Adding more \"steps\" when removing or placing the tray. At first I avoided this hassle by putting the trays on my island or kitchen table while not in use. However, this was not an option after my one year olds discovered they too could lift the front of the infant insert up!  Because I don't clean under the insert after every single meal this usually means one of my kid's got a piece of last meal's food in their mouth or on the floor. So, back to putting the tray on all the time to prevent this.I just received two IKEA Antilops today!  I cannot wait to use them. The Keekaros are being posted on Craigslist. I attached a photo of bits of breakfast fallen into the holes.

In short, the front wheel. The front wheel is fine when locked for running, it is a bit loose but nothing too concerning, it's when  you put it in the unlocked position that the construction of this beast becomes apparent. With the wheel set to turn \"free\", the wheel is very loose. I took the stroller back to REI to see if it was something that could be tightened and the tech said, it was held in by a cotter pin and just a plastic bushing. I checked myself and sure enough, there is no bearing, and the fitment is just awful. This slop has caused some serious close calls with the stroller tipping over.Example, if you are walking on a sidewalk and you need to go down a crosswalk, if you turn the stroller, then push forward, the wheel does not straighten on it's own, it is too loose and it gets hung up and the stroller can tip over easily if you are not careful, the only way to correct this is by going backwards and in a clean motion push it forward to have the wheel go to the correct direction. For a direct competitor to the BOB, the reason I think the front wheel design is like this is because the wheel folds flat(ish) when collapsed. Thule skimped out on the engineering in the front hub system, and made it too lose and didn't even bother putting in bearings (like bikes have in their hubs).

Once again, he is just normal size, so this is a serious flaw. I had a Fischer Price model with my daughter. That model had a much longer area between baby and the top of the frame.

This chair is literally TORTURE on our little one, and we have literally thrown away and purchased a different set for a fraction of the price that does not inflict severe harm on our baby.As mentioned in the other reviews, the baby can only be inserted in the chair by forcing the legs at such a weird angle that his/her legs are contorted at the very best.  TEARS and more tears.  clearly this was NEVER designed as a baby chair, and to throw this \"baby set\" in as an afterthought is absolutely fraudulent and cruel to TT customers' babies .Interestingly, in wondering how anyone could rate this product anything better than HORRIBLE, I read in one \"positive\" review that one can simply \"pinch\" the tab that holds the baby seat on and lift up ,and voile, the baby will come out without breaking his/her legs in the process.  Excuse me?  This is the tab than holds the baby seat down in the front, and the plastic is hard and stiff so the idea of \"pinching\" it is a joke.  More like, get your husband and two neighbors to help squeeze the incredible stiff pieces together while kneeling under the chair, and then take a hammer (all with your baby still in the chair) and pound on the tab until it pushes up through the extremely tight hole.  THIS PIECE IS BUILT TO REMAIN INSTALLED, and the idea that one satisfied customer has to literally remove the entire baby seat in order to remove the baby (without the baby's legs being broken or hyper-extended) simply confirms the reality that this baby seat is defectively designed.  That this customer is furthermore satisfied with this makeshift \"solution\" to a horrendous problem only shows that they are clearly desperate to avoid admitting that they have wasted their money on this horrendous product.I also feel horrible about this complete waste of money and have tried with my husband to figure out some way that we can live with our mistake, but at the end of the day a real high chair is not that expensive and it is more important for us to be have something we actually feel comfortable using, that does not involve me breaking my nails and using a hammer to hammer the baby seat off every time I want to remove my baby.

Once assembled it does what it claims, and seems pretty (it matches the paint for the room). But man is it hard to assemble.The instructions are atrocious. Beyond bad. Dangerously so. I have some commercial furniture design experience, and have assembled hundreds of items as summer jobs, and could barely get this together right. By \"dangerously\" I mean that many instructions are so bad and the design is so vague that you can assemble it wrong. Most people on finding this won't re-assemble it right, and so things will fall apart and then we'll have another public safety recall, so there's that.Hardware out of spec. Had to file some of the barrels to fit. Sure, I could have hit them with a hammer, but on MDF, that would damage the substrate and cause a failure. In my experience, most people will leave them out and that sacrifices strength, so again a dangerous situation.The replacement for the cam lock is extremely sketchy feeling. The threaded inserts are very, very hard to install, do not pull the assembly into tightness so you need to first get them perfectly aligned (deadblow hammer helps, clamping was required) and don't feel like they will stay. A philips screwdriver WILL NOT tighten them enough; it's a cross-straight not a philips head so tighten them with a large flat head screwdriver. Also, I managed to cross-thread one. At least it won't come out! Warning: It is possible to tighten them the pins too far out, so they are not locking and holding the crib together.Much assembly can only be done from inside the crib. Good luck getting out after you have it together.The feet are hideous, with black brackets and shiny hardware visible. Also, you will need a 10 mm wrench to tighten them. Not included, not mentioned in the instructions.As others mentioned, the included mattress (NOT WHAT IS SHOWN IN MOST PHOTOS) is very, very, very thin. And so loose and soft it's not useful anyway. If you get a normal 3-4\" mattress, now there's no rails to speak of. So, DO NOT ASSEMBLE AS SHOWN.

Sadly, it is true that the motor burned out, after owning this for less than 2 years. It worked for the duration of time my daughter used it, then just recently burned out, and my son is only 5 months and weighs 15 pounds. This was hugely disappointing, as we paid close to $300, when it first came out. At that price, this swing should have lasted at least through 2 babies.The central point (as opposed to dual points) makes the swing feel weak and unstable. Although I realize the purpose is to be able to change the position, it still could be designed better. This central pressure point could also be why the motor burns out quickly. This could just be my preference but I was uncomfortable with the swings stability way before the weight limit was reached.My second complaint is the material that the cradle is made from. It is cheaply made. it is advertised as machine washable, however once I wahed and dried it (according to the directions) it bunched up and \"melted together\" in some spots. With difficulty, I was able to stretch it back over the frame, but there are some weak/bunched spots still. To be fair, it is soft and comfortable with the inserts.Other issues that are of less importance but are still worth mentioning; the lambs did get stuck at some points and make a loud clacking noise. Mostly, it was because the \"fabric collar\" got stuck and prevented the lambs from moving. It would also get stuck as my daughter got older and could reach the lambs. This isn't really a design flaw, but it's noteworthy. The sound has nature/music settings and although both my children enjoyed and would fall asleep to the nature sounds, the music is more upbeat and \"entertaining\". Depending on your purpose, that can be good or bad. Point being, it definitely doesn't play lullabies.The mobile lights are nice, no real complaints although they can be bright if you want your little one to sleep. I did want to mention that one reviewer said the lights and mobile (lambs)have to be on at the same time, that is actually inaccurate. each time you press the button the setting changes so that you can have both going or one or the other. In other words, if you just want the lights and not the lambs going, press the button twice.Bottom line, I honestly can say that I had high hopes for this swing, and it served it's purpose while it worked, but if I had known the motor would burn out after a year or so I would not have purchased it.", "review_id": "R1T1ZFN4H710Q1", "asin": "B0085425Y2", "proba": "97.3%", "product_name": "Fisher-Price My Little Lamb Platinum Edition Cradle 'n Swing"}, {"id": 366, "title": "Works but not great", "review": "Initially I bought a WEE-Ride bike mount because I just wasn't sure how much leg room my 2 year old would actually have between the handle bars and the seat with the iBert.

The side that goes up and down feels like it is going to break as we would lower the side.  You have to push the side in before lowering it, this made the wood bend a little and I thought it would break!  The crib is covered in scratches, somehow, since it scratches and the finish comes off very easily.  We amazingly have made this crib last 2 years, but have thought so many times that it was going to fall apart.  There are 2 screws that have fallen out and it seems as though the holes they go in are way to big, so they just float in there doing very little to hold the crib together.  On several occassions, I went to tuck my 23 month old in and the side was down.  It is difficult to get the side to stay up anymore.

It was unbelievably bad - like, I couldn't even conceive of all of the problems we experienced with this chair. I am a first time mom and bought many baby products without knowing exactly how things would be used and this was the only product that was a complete and utter fail.  I purchased the chair, baby set, cushion and tray - the whole shebang - and after just a few weeks of trying this chair out, I was in tears out of frustration and all of the money we had spent on it. After reading so many positive reviews for this chair, my best guess is that this chair works out well for some babies, and it's unbelievably bad for others. It seems that the baby set and accessories are poorly rated overall and perhaps that this chair is best for older babies (6+ months) and those that are sitting very well without support and do not need the baby set or tray for extra balance.Here are the issues I had with this chair:1. The baby seat is incredibly hard and rigid and SMALL. My small/average-sized 8 month old could hardly get in the baby seat and tray. I don't know how he would fit in the baby set in a few months, let alone a year down the road. Part of the issue is that getting a baby in the seat is like putting them in a baby swing at a park, except imagine a tray obstructing the front half of the swing. Even removing the tray to get my baby in made no difference. His legs would tense up and he would not bend his legs to maneuver through the tight, rigid space. I was worried that the rigid, hard plastic would scratch his legs. What baby knows when to straighten and relax his legs? I ended up getting the OXO Sprout chair which allows me to place the baby right on the seat around the crotch post so there is no need to thread baby legs through a ridiculous baby seat. It's infinitely easier for me and the baby.2. Impossible to adjust. Once you assemble the chair, you have to get out the Allen wrench, take it apart and reconfigure it. What parent on this planet has time to do this?3. The cushions are so poorly designed. The seat cushion does not stay latched on the backside of the seat so when the baby comes through the baby seat, his legs push the cushion off and it gets all out of position. The cushions are also impossible to remove from the ridiculous harness setup for washing. Had I kept the chair, I never would have washed those cushions because they were such a pain to remove. It would have been so disgusting.4. Why on earth is this chair so hard and uncomfortable? Sure it might look cool, but think about it - does it look appealing to sit in? NO! Unfortunately, I was so seduced by the cool, modern look of the chair when I bought it and didn't even think of how extremely uncomfortable it looked. When I placed my baby in the chair, even at the highest settings, when he wiggled around and leaned back or to the side, he would hit is head on the hard posts. He would cry and get so upset :(5. Stokke customer service is pathetic. I did request a new side leg after the one I received was chipped and they sent that out quickly and without much issue. However, when I called to complain about the many issues I was having, their solution was not to refund my purchase or exchange for a new product, or even to refer me to someone local who could help - but they wanted me to send in videos and pictures explaining the problem, and they would send very unhelpful video responses. This is not what I would expect for a company with such high ratings and such an expensive product. I guess the way they see it, they have so many good reviews that they can ignore the bad ones.", "review_id": "R1OWGETG3A2I9P", "asin": "B01MRYD4NK", "proba": "97.03%", "product_name": "Stokke Tripp Trapp Complete - Aqua Blue"}, {"id": 374, "title": "I really wanted this to work out.", "review": "I spent a lot of time researching lightweight strollers for my little one. I read all about the RECARO Easylife via European bloggers and reviewers and I was so excited to preorder my own when I found out that RECARO would soon be releasing a model within the USA. I waited for months and it finally arrived this week. There are some features that are good -- but others that are not good at all.I'll start with the good. It is most definitely lightweight and it folds up very small. The harness seems comfortable on my 10-month-old. There is lots of ventilation on the sides of the stroller and through the mesh peek-a-boo window on top. I also like the look, or style, of the stroller.Okay, now the not so good. First, the handle bar is not adjustable and it feels awkwardly too tall for me. I am 5'2\" and my arms are angled upward to push the stroller and it just feels uncomfortable and difficult to steer. The size of the basket is smaller than I expected, but I suppose it is a small stroller -- so therefore the basket needs to be small to fit the small frame.Alright, now the not good at all. The front wheels can be locked so that they don't swivel (that's a neat feature). What's not neat, is that one wheel will randomly lock when folding/unfolding the stroller and sometimes when simply pushing the stroller. And now, onto the biggest problem: the stroller frame is difficult to open and it is challenging to determine when it is fully opened -- which can create a safety hazard. Particularly, the front hinges toward the bottom. Sometimes they appear straight/open, but they are just slightly bent and not locked -- this is dangerous as it causes the stroller to collapse.All in all, I was hoping for more. I called RECARO, asking if the USA model was identical to the European model -- and I was told that they are not the same. Based on the glowing reviews from the European mothers, it is clear that the USA model of this stroller is subpar in comparison.", "review_id": "R3CBNXNLWHGET3", "asin": "B01C38QIFW", "proba": "96.92%", "product_name": "RECARO Easylife Ultra-lightweight Stroller, Graphite"}, {"id": 375, "title": "dangerous if you're a petite mom!", "review": "I researched soooo many child seats and wanted this one to work.

However...Cons: Given how fancy-schmancy the rest of the product is (e.g., bluetooth, iPhone app, audio port), I am very peeved that the plastic holding the little dangly toys (\"Overhead toy mobile with reversible toys\") broke almost immediately. The whole arm-attachment seemed relatively flimsy from the get-go, ostensibly to make it easier to disassemble, but now the plastic inside the long bow-like silver piece that connects to the overhead mobile toy has chipped away and broken (as shown in uploaded photo), causing the arm that dangles precariously above my child to be even closer to his face, rather than more arcing and erect (as shown in the product photo). It is pretty ridiculous they couldn't spring for the few extra cents/unit it would require to reinforce the plastic around where it connects to the \"Overhead toy mobile with reversible toys\"--again, for all the technology involved (AND THE COST), for the product to break in this manner was exceedingly disappointing.

Basically you let them sleep in a swing (sleep safe one) in their room and then eventually transfer to their crib. This seemed like the ultimate hack for that program!I bought it and was happy but frustrated that my 3mo who's in he 90s for height and weight was pretty close to the limits on both but that's not the manufacturer's fault. What is their fault and failure is their timer and/or motor.The first one I had (yes, you read that right!) worked great then randomly started turning off. Like it would run for 8 hrs straight always plugged in but then the next night would turn off in the middle of the night and of course my son would wake up after only 2hrs of sleep. I thought my older child had been in there pushing buttons at first and kept trying to correct my poor daughter. Then I kept running through the timer sequence to turn off the timer (which I figured she had some how turned on). Mine doesn't have a red button, my buttons are green and they flash. I would go through the sequence and then the things would turn off so I assumed that meant I had reset it. So one night I check the monitor before going to bed and it had been about an hour since he had gone down and the swing is not moving but the light is lit from the motor like it thought it was moving. There is nothing around the swing, it's in the middle of the room, so it wasn't caught on anything. I go into the room and it's making this scary grinding noise like it's revving really hard and it sounded like it was going to pop or something. I tried turning it off, it didn't work. I tried changing the speed, it didn't work. So now I'm trying not to panic and I get on my hands and knees and unplug the thing and it finally stops. I plug it back in and turn it on and it's swinging like nothing happened. I was terrified. What if it had spontaneously combusted with my baby in it?!I called graco the next day to describe it and first they looked to see if there was a replacement timer. None. Ok so they looked for the motor bc that would replace the whole thing. Nope. So they looked for a DIFFERENT MODEL (uh wut?) but nothing came up. They said they would replace the swing. But to do this, they wanted me to pack the thing up and send it to them BEFORE they would process my replacement. So it would take a 1-4 days assuming my return arrived without delay and they inspected it, deemed it faulty and shipped my replacement the same day. Yeah right. I said I wanted a replacement sent to me with a shipping label for me to return this one. They said ok, we can do that but YOU NEED TO VIDEO THE SWING DOING WHAT IT DID! Huh? You want me to video the swing for 1-5 hrs until it makes that noise again or turns off? You crazy.So since I bought it at BRU I packed it up and exchanged it at the store and told them about my conversations with graco. So now this new swing? Same thing happens! Both were manufactured in Nov. 2016 so maybe it's a bad batch? I don't know. But if I ask my husband to take this thing apart and build a new one for the 3rd time, he will straight divorce me and I can't have my family torn apart bc graco can't get its shit together.So you get 3 stars.

We were really excited about the purchase and although it was a splurge ($250 for a high chair is not cheap!) we thought we would get years of use out of it for our first baby and hopefully for any future babies. Unfortunately, I dont think this will be the case. The tray of the chair is already discolored!! I could not believe it. I ALWAYS wash the tray immediately after a feeding with hot, soapy water (as instructed by manufacturer). My little guy just started solids, he only eats twice a day and I spoon feed him (not as messy as if he were feeding himself). This means the chair has literally been used less than 25 times! It's absolutely ridiculous that the tray is discolored already and wasn't able to hold up to two weeks of use! This is obviously some sort of defect with the tray. I have contacted the manufacturer and will update my review once I receive more information from them. I would hope they would replace the tray.  I would be very hesitant to spend this kind of money on a high chair that is such terrible quality. I regret my purchase and wish I would have bought the Stokke Tripp Trapp.UPDATE: I contacted customer service about the discoloration and their response was to continue washing it and over time, it should fade. I couldn't believe how ridiculous and unhelpful this response was. I was able to get some of the discoloration out using baking soda. But, of course, I dont have time to do this regularly. I have a new problem now, the inside of the tray seems to be taking on water and I am unable to  get it out. I am disgusted at the idea of old, stale water sitting inside the tray my baby eats off. I plan to contact customer service again but based on their unhelpful response before, I am not hopeful. I am definitely NOT SATISFIED with my purchase.Update (5/2012): I contacted customer service for the 2nd time and had a much better experience. They expressed shipped a new tray to me which I really appreciated. Unfortunately, I continue to have the same problems with the new tray. I don't mind the staining but the water inside the tray really disgusts me. I worry there is mold inside of the tray.

It is a nice looking item, but the directions for putting it together are a bit sub par.  A couple of the pieces do not fit as they should on the changer.  The support that runs under the drawers on the inside leg is almost a 1/2\" longer than the other 4 \"corners\" causing the side piece not to sit quite right.  As well, one of the panels was too tall and made a gap when trying to attach the same a fore mentioned piece.  One of the supports has a groove in it for one of the panels to sit in and it wasn't wide enough like all the others!  Luckily we have a table saw and were able to \"widen\" the groove enough to get the panel to slide in, but without that it wouldn't have fit.  Same for the piece that makes up the flat surface of the actual changing table surface.  We had to cut it down as well to get it to fit properly.  AND in the directions it specifically tells you to use 2 of the Security Barrel Nuts to attach the side of the crib, but also says to use the same Barrel Nuts elsewhere.  There are only 8 of them and the directions tell you to use 10.  There are 2 other Barrel Nuts that are slightly different that the directions should say to use instead, but they don't.  We did figure it out, but we had to undo what we had already completed to fix the problem.  Lastly, the pieces don't fit together as nicely as you would think they should.  like the 2 pieces on top of the headboard and foot-board that make this a sleigh design.

The set of hardware that came in the original packaging was silver in color and the cam nuts did not stay in the cam locks.  It was almost impossible to get them in.  My husband had to flie down some of them, and then they started popping out and it was a major safety issue, as the crib was falling apart.  I called the number for the MDB manufacturer (323) 728-8988.  They sent another set of the cam bolts, locks and nuts and they worked like a charm...easy, effortless.  I noticed that the new set of hardware has a gold/bronze sheen over the silver color.  Another difference is that a phillips screw driver works easily with the new set of hardware.  So if you are having problems with assembling your crib, call the manufacturer and ask for new hardware, the good stuff.  For the amount of money spent on this crib, I would hope that the company would want a sturdy and safe crib and provide us with the correct hardware in the first place.Also, I agree that there is a harsh chemical smell to the paint that needs to air out in an open space for at least a week.

I had high hopes for this gliding swing, swayed by the quality of the Graco brand. I am sorry to say that I am pretty disappointed in the actual product, right out of the box.  The directions are surprisingly difficult to follow, and I'm not embarrassed to say that it took three adults in my house to successfully put this together. At one point, the directions seemed a little faulty, or at the very least misleading.  I could tell that we were not off to a good start.Then it came time to put my five-month-old daughter in the swing.  The arch overhead has two small plush hearts attached with tiny pieces of Velcro.  Naturally, as intended, these came off quite easily.  They are not choking hazards, but it nevertheless struck me as inefficient that these little Velcro hearts came off so easily (and were a little more difficult to re-attach).  But the real problem was with the overhead arch itself.  It snaps onto the sides of the swing, and I was very disappointed to see my five-month-old yank the arch down immediately.  I reattached it, and the exact same thing happened five more times in under two minutes.  The arch is not secure in any way, and I won't risk leaving my daughter's side with it attached to the swing.  Without it, of course, it's just a very simple swing with nothing overhead to attract the baby's attention.There were some positive elements, however.  The swing function works well, and the music selections are nice and varied.  And with or without the overhead arch, my daughter seems to really enjoy the swing (totally unaware of her parent's frustrations).  I suppose this is an \"OK\" swing, but for my money I would go with a different model or brand.

Great value, took about 90 minutes to assemble (had to fix several things that shouldn't have to be fixed if it arrived properly) but the overall quality is poorish / okay...  It does its job, and I don't see it nor ever intend it to last more than a few years (or several moves for a military family).In my attached photos:[Update] 1. After two days the mattress (comes with a mattress cover) has inflated to its advertised 5\" thickness and on the firm side (good for cribs) and just the right length/width for the crib.  But the misleading ad picture here with the bed skirt (not included) makes the mattress look much thicker than it really is.2.  Low quality wood veneer on the legs leaves a sandpaper like finish on the bed leg corners.  From the photo, the flat sides of the bed legs are shiny & smooth but at the corners where the veneer wraps around, the veneer is rough, thin, brittle & cracked. Thankfully its only on the legs and not the frame slats.3.  Half of the included hex screws arrived stripped so much that only a millimeter of the allen wrench went in (not enough to torque down the screw as the wrench would slip).  Thankfully, I have my own allen wrench set to find smaller sized wrenches that fit.4.  Missing screw & lack of part #s for the screws & nuts (frame parts were in there) in the assembly instructions.  Combined with the badly stripped screws, made me request another kit from Storkcraft (will update review upon receipt of replacement screw & how long it took).[Update] Received the replacement hardware parts (screws) 11 days after filling a replacement claim from Storkcraft (filed the same day I received the crib).  This new set's screws thankfully were not stripped like the last set.5.  The main headboard was poorly finished on the ends as you can see either scratches or a bad paint job; a wood knot (bump) sticking out; and worn down edges all around.6.  Two of the pre-drilled hex nut holes were only partially drilled in.  I had to drill in and scrape out about .5cm of wood material to get the hex nuts to fit into the proper depth.7.  Safety Labels everywhere (matches Graco's safety oriented reputation) so much so that they safety tagged inside AND outside of the side rails.  Only a problem if you're a room designer type and hate the obvious tacky tags stick out.8.  There is no pre-designed separate purchasable bed frame for this crib.  The included picture shows that any generic bed frame should fit to the head & foot boards of the crib.  But as the frame slats are so thin (that a 5th Grader can Karate chop his way through), I don't see this lasting long enough to see life converted as a Full Size bed frame.[Update] 9.  All the drilled in screw points are fairly rough edged and close to half are not hidden.  If you're into aesthetics, it's a sore point as the dark veneer contrasts easily with the pale interior wood.  Would recommend adding screw covers (or a veneer tape) to improve the design.One or two defects are fine but compounding all those minor defects plus having me McGuyver a few thigns makes me recommend Graco fire whoever quality controled this crib & allow it to have the Graco name on it.

Stokke does have shoulder harness, but seat and tray are purchased separately which equals to more money. Overall, Abiie fits the bill. I was able to get it on fantastic sale price.

While the seat does come off easily, this leaves the \"Stinger bar\" exposed and moving when you turn your handle bars.  If you have to stop suddenly, it would be very easy to gore yourself.  The entire Stinger assembly can be removed in less than 5min, so it may not be a big deal, but iBert claims you can leave it on when you ride without the child seat.

I only bought it from Amazon because it was $10 cheaper than in store....very poor choice. I give this 2 stars because I really liked it in store and think it would be great but I bought it from the wrong company and I'd like to see them make this right. I spent $167 on this and I expected a new and great swing.After opening the box and taking all the protective plastic, foam and cardboard off, I started to notice that different pieces were dinged up, scratched or nicked...as though this was a display model or something. The first few nicks didn't bother me until I found that the top of it was very scuffed up, the top where you would look at often. In addition, the see through cover where your phone would go and the baby can see through it was all scratched up; almost like someone dropped it or tossed is across the concrete and it scratched the plastic.The instructions are pictures only. Would have been fine if the pieces were number or front and back was indicated but they were not. It was pretty self explanatory until the last 3 steps...then it took a few extra minutes of trial and error to get the seat cover on. In all, it took me about 45 minutes to assemble.Now it was time to plug it in. I was a little disappointed that the plug came with different adapters; to me, this seemed like a waste of other products and I have a slight fear that this could short...my husband thought it was a cool feature because now we can travel to Germany and take this with us....*stupid*After hooking up the correct adapter, we plugged it in and found that the mirror rotation thing does not rotate. We took it off, reattached it and snapped it back on and it still does not spin. I also noticed that it looks like the spinner mirror thing has already been used because there's a burn spot on the inside where it looks like the bulb has burn through it.I would love to return this and spend the extra $10 to but it in store, but I don't think there's any way I can get this all back on the box and ship it back.

First thing I noticed is that it is not the colors I expected. I thought by the picture that the fabric would be grey, pink, & white with grey legs. Well it is actually lavender, pink, and off white and the legs are kind've a brown color. The colors make it look dirty in my opinion. I also notice that the seat is quite hard which I also did not expect. I thought it would be more cushioned.What I like about it so far though is that 1.) my baby seems to like it which is always important, 2.) it rocks super easy. With her bouncer it doesn't take much effort to bounce, but as soon as I stop it stops too. This doesn't do that. Of course I am rocking her on a hard wood floor, but I can easily sit on my couch and rock it with my big toe and if I need a break and stop it will keep rocking on it's own for several minutes which I love. I also love the fact that this one vibrates since that is the one thing about her swing/bouncer she really likes too so the fact that I can let her sleep in this at night by my bed and still have that vibrating feature is a real plus. That is all I have for now. Will update again when I have used it for longer than a day. Hoping the color grows on me.Update: I bought this because, like many others, my baby would only sleep being held. I was reluctant after researching the Rock N Play and seeing that they have had some issues with mold, but decided that since I was aware of that issue I could watch for it and keep it clean. Well after using it for the first week I went to clean it as per the instructions and was shocked to see that there was actually a puddle of water in the base of seat under the cover and of course instantly see why the moisture is such an issue. I am not sure it is possible to keep this clean and dry enough (depending on where you live and the humidity level) to prevent mold from growing on it. It is literally a petri dish. For that reason, I am considering sending it back. This is a tough decision though because my daughter does like to sleep in it which has been great for getting her out of my arms and out of my bed.I hope Fisher Price is able to find a way to remedy this issue with future models beyond just giving cleaning instructions as it is a great concept and probably one of the best baby products on the market otherwise.", "review_id": "R1RKDD6VNSMDPF", "asin": "B016APS2PS", "proba": "91.08%", "product_name": "Fisher-Price My Little Snugabear Forest Edition Deluxe Newborn Rock 'N Play Sleeper"}, {"id": 480, "title": "It did not come with the toddler rail like it said it was suppose to", "review": "Bought this crib for my daughter.

Most of my kitchen tools and utensils are OXO. We also really like the OXO Tot line - use the spoons, sippy cup, storage containers, dish washer rack etc. from the OXO Tot line and we absolutely love it. Based on our experience with this brand and the positive reviews on Amazon, we bought the OXO Tot High Chair for our daughter. But, we were severely disappointed. The chair looks great but has some serious design flaws:1) The tray: I knew the tray is not dishwasher safe, and this did not bother me. So, I hand washed the tray. To my surprise, the tray is built with two plastic pieces that have been put together with the help of about 15 screws. And, after a quick wash, I realized that water had gone inside the tray. Now, I hope OXO does not think that I will unscrew the tray, every time I have to clean it?2) There is a gap between back of the chair and the sides, small enough that my daughter's arm gets stuck in it. We tried about 10 times, and each time, that is what happened. It did not hurt my daughter, but it is kinda weird to see her arm kinda dangling on the side. This seems like bad design as I would think there are others who have also had this problem.3) The leg separator in the chair is quite big and seems like it will be a problem soon, as the child grows. The manual does say that it can be removed once the tray is not being used (once the child is 3 years old), but is seems like it would be an issue even before that.I am definitely surprised that this is an OXO product given my experience with the OXO line of products that I have been using for many years now.Hope this helps.FYI: We returned the chair and bought the Boon Flair.

It's a sleek design with a small footprint--great for small spaces! I love that the wood structure fits in well with my decor and has a traditional yet modern feel.

I don't love that the cushions Velcro on and that you can't easily clean the straps since they're not removable, but those things aren't too bothersome considering the other advantages of the chair. It worked great when my daughter was just eating purees and wasn't very messy. HOWEVER...There's one thing I can't get over! Now that my daughter has started eating finger foods off of the tray I've realized that the tray is almost impossible to keep clean. For one, I've noticed that it stains easily. I feel like it needs to be washed with soap and water after feedings, but because the tray is made of 2 separate pieces screwed together water easily seaps through the seems and into the inside of the tray--and I've been very careful to lightly rinse & not submerge the tray. I'm afraid of mold growth, as others have mentioned, as that would make it an unhealthy place for my daughter to eat! I just don't understand why OXO did not design the tray with a removable cover that could pop off for easy cleaning--something that's even dishwasher safe like they have on the OXO seedling high chair. In my opinion, that would solve this problem & make this an excellent chair!

It appears the only kind of bike this actually fits is a very large framed mountain bike that has a sloped top tube.2) The mounting point for the seat onto the bracket is secured by one small aluminum bolt, and when mounted, the seat is wobbly and insecure.3) The plastic for the seat is flimsy and too flexible4) The belts are not sized or mounted in such a way that the child can be secured safely and comforably. I suspect the designers practiced with dolls and did not factor in the ability for the child to move or even breathe5) Sharp \"flash\" on the molding areas that can cut skin.6) No protection or support for the child's head. Children fall asleep when riding, and there is nothing to support the child's head if sleeping, nor any way of extending the seat.7) No protection in the event of a fall for shoulders or head, as with other child bike seats.

My oldest is now riding his own bike independently and I only need the carrier for my youngest child for short trips.  I thought this carrier would be the perfect option!  Unfortunately it just didn't live up to my expectations.  I accidentally snapped the clasp for the chest strap while trying to shove it through the much too small plastic hole.  I am taking part of the blame because I was really shoving it through but still, it shouldn't be that hard.  Once I sort of rigged that back together and my husband kept trying to attach this to my bike.  Full disclosure my bike is very old but the instructions on this carrier clearly stated that you couldn't attach it to the area beneath your seat if your brake cables ran through it.  Well mine did so this made the installation of this seat impossible on my bike.  OK fine...time to just put it on my husband's bike and I would have used his bike for short rides around the neighborhood.  It installed on his much newer bike very quickly and easily.  My almost 2 year old son enjoyed sitting in it and it appeared to be comfortable.  However, it just seemed too flimsy for me to trust it.  I don't know the whole thing was made of relatively thin plastic, the straps didn't seem nearly secure enough, I just couldn't get past my safety concerns to strap my baby behind me and hit the road with it.  I think I am just much more comfortable with the trailer style of bike carriers for my children.  My oldest son just turned 4 and could transfer to a booster car seat based on his height and weight and I still have him in a super expensive and safe Britax carseat that is engineered for older children.  I just want to give you a frame of reference that I definitely err on the side of overly safe when it comes to my kids.

Here are the pros and cons of this swing.Pros:* Convertible.  Can be used as both a swing and a bouncy seat.  The seat unclips from the swing frame with quick release and can then sit on the floor.  The vibration and sound is located in the seat so that those goes with the seat and aren't still back in the swing.* 3 Swing Positions.  Front, left, and right facing.  Good if you place the frame near a window and want baby looking out the window when it isn't sunny or away when it is without having to rearrange the swing.* Almost no tools required assembly.  A Philips #2 (medium + shape) screwdriver is only required to attach the sound/vibration unit and insert batteries.  The rest of the swing and seat frames all just clip together.* Swing can be powered with a wall socket.  That would have saved me a ton of D batteries with our first swing.* Handsome color deco.  This is obviously personal preference, but the pewter-y grey with soft white is simple and tasteful IMHO.* Toys included.  2 small stuffed bears for visual interest.* Sunshade.  My wife really loves this as it allows the lights to be on in the room  and not affect the baby as much as they aren't shining into his eyes as he sleeps.* Fully washable.  The cover comes off easily enough for washing.* Numberous sound and vibration settings.  Heartbeat, wave, bee, driving, there are a ton here.* Adjustable volume.* Small amount of recline of the seat when in the swing frame.Cons:* Assembly instructions were could use some serious improvement.  Getting the swing together isn't difficult but trying to Seuss out which piece is which and whether your inserting it in the correct direction isn't as clear cut as it should be.  Simple end labeling could have solved a LOT of this.* Randomly the stuffed bears face AWAY from baby.* Vibration made the entire sound/vibration unit rattle causing a very unpleasant sound to come out of it when the vibration was on.  The battery compartment comes with something that resembled a dried up dish sponge I assume to act as a cushion to dampen vibration but it just couldn't come close to doing its job.  I had to add some weather stripping to the battery compartment to fix this issue and I shouldn't have to do that.* Wiring harness.  Part of the assembly is connecting the plug-in wiring harness that goes from the bottom of the frame to the swing unit at the top of the frame.  But the way it goes together the amount of slack I had to stuff inside the frame makes me quite nervous that the whole thing will be a big hazard going forward.  Maybe I'm being paranoid but it just makes me queasy.Summary.This is a decent swing that packs some very good ideas into a single package but the assembly, vibration, and wiring issues leave me with issues that I think this unit shouldn't have.Edit:I just finished completely disassembling the sound/vibration unit to try to get the horrible grinding noise when the vinration is on under control.  I added sticky back foam tape to the back of the battery case, the speaker, and while there was some on the vibration motor, even more.  I can say that the unit performs much better but still isn't as good as I'd like it.  the grinding sound is gone but you can still tell sonically when the vibration unit is running.", "review_id": "R1TKVGQ6636QRR", "asin": "B01BGVLQCC", "proba": "88.36%", "product_name": "Graco Duet Oasis with Soothe Surround Baby Swing, Davis"}, {"id": 521, "title": "It broke within a day it fell from my daughters ...", "review": "It broke within a day it fell from my daughters hand in the kitchen and wouldn't stop repeating, the screen flashes the same pattern over and over.

They all typically cost between $120-$160.2) They are not quiet. My son weighs about 10 pounds and all I hear all day is \"clunk clunk, clunk clunk\".3) The motors are pathetic.

I had registered for it because it had many good reviews and was from Fisher Price, a quality name in baby products. We were very happy to receive the gift and assembled it approx 6 weeks before out baby was due, as we were finishing up the nursery and getting everything in place. I was impressed with the materials used, they are very soft and nice to the touch. I also liked the folding feature that allowed you to store it with less space.However, once I assembled it I turned it on.... it all went downhill from there. The swing immediately started making a loud grinding and cracking noise. I immediately shut it off and looked over everything to make sure it was assembled properly and that I didn't have something messed up. Everything looked ok, so I turned it back on, it made the same noises. I tapped it a couple times thinking something was out of place, no luck.I looked online and found several reviews noting that the swing made noises of varying degrees. I thought maybe mine was just defective so I went to my local Toys R Us to see if they had one on display and if it made any noises. Luckily they did have on on display with batteries in it. I turned it on and it made the same noises, although not as loud as mine. At this point I decided this must be a flow in the mechanism design. I really wanted to like this, but I did not feel comfortable that, even if I got a quiet replacement, the swing would hold up in the long run.I contacted Fisher Price's customer support via e-mail on the Sunday that I assembled the swing about the noise asking if it was normal and if there was a way to correct the problem. Later that day I visited Toys r Us and exchanged the swing for a model by a different manufacturer, as the display made the same noises.I was VERY impressed with Fisher Price's follow up and attempt to resolve the situation. I received a reply on Tuesday (2 business days) from a service rep. She apologized for the problem and told me that a replacement motor had been shipped to me. I replied explaining that I had already bought a replacement. They told me the motor was already shipped and not to worry about returning it. The new motor arrived on Thursday, 2 days after the response and 4 days after my complaint. i was very impressed that they took such quick and immediate action to remedy the problem.UNFORTUNATELY, I unpacked the new motor and powered it up to see how it worked. It made the exact same noises. This confirmed my suspicion that it was a design flaw and not a fluke that my original swing made noises. It appears as though the motor and gears are made of plastic and not to the tightest specs.Again, I was quite pleased with the customer service, however I don't think there is anyway they could have corrected this situation short of redesigning the swing motor mechanism.

It wipes clean. It can be un-buttoned and taken off for more cleaning. The chair is multi-functional (which is always good with this baby stuff). It moves around easily. The tray is cool and also very easily washed. It could last a very long time - it is a large seat that can accommodate a big kid.The not so good: The directions are complicated. There is a learning curve to get the hang of all the functions. And, the most annoying (for us), our toddler loved to hang off the back of this chair. It didn't matter where we put it. There was something super interesting about crawling all over and hanging off of this thing. The dangerous part of this is that if you look at the picture there are two holes in the base, one towards the front and one towards the back. Her foot would get stuck in the hole and she could potentially fall. Luckily I was always right there and the worst never happened - but I know I don't have the only kid that likes to climb on things and these holes in the base (especially the size that they are) seem like a design flaw. When she turned one I bought a booster seat and, with much relief, put this high chair up (until the next one ;) )Overall, I really do like the chair. But, every time I would see my child's eyes lock in on the chair....every time I could sense she was thinking about climbing on it....I felt a little dread for the upcoming ordeal of peeling her off of it and distracting her onto something else. I realize you could probably fold the whole thing up after every meal...but hey....I'm a little busy for that.", "review_id": "R2ERA5FQV00C4T", "asin": "B017O6NW5M", "proba": "82.89%", "product_name": "Peg Perego Tatamia Stripes, Grey"}, {"id": 570, "title": "Very Impractical Chair", "review": "I, like many out there with the negative reviews, really wanted to like this chair. It's just not that practical for use with a baby or toddler. We've been using for the last ten months (6m - 14m). I kinda got sold on its looks and the fact that it's made out of wood. I really don't have experience with any other type of high chair (other than restaurant style ones) - I just know that this one leaves much to be desired.What I don't like:1. Tray requires two hands to remove - you have to release the clamps on each side of the tray simultaneously and then slide the tray off completely to get the child out. With a lot of struggling, you can release one side at a time and wiggle that side loose and repeat on the other side if you only have one hand but it's a major pain. It's a big enough pain that when we're not using the high chair, we don't store the tray on the high chair. It's usually hanging out on the dining table or propped up against the wall.2. The 3 point restraint system seems like it wouldn't be effective. The anchor points all originate from the seat plate (and are threaded through the seat cushion) and it really looks like two straps that restrain the upper thighs. Granted, our child has not gotten out or even tried to get out, but it is a worry. Basically, I never have him in the chair unless I have the tray snuggled right up next to him so he won't be tempted to climb out. Hopefully, that lasts for a while.3. The finish is chipped or worn in certain places (I have the mahogany finish) - especially on the tray. In fact, on the arms of the tray, there are clear stickers that you aren't supposed to remove to minimize ruining the finish as you insert and remove the tray. My stickers are still on but I still have finish that's chipped off along the flat surface of the tray as well as the non stickered parts of the tray arms.4. I wouldn't recommend using this with an infant <1y without the back cushion (that you get with the comfort cushion set) because the infant insert is awfully roomy for a small baby and the chair back is hard. You can use the back cushion with the infant insert.5. I've had to re-tighten the screws a couple times in the past 10 months when i noticed the chair was wiggling a bit. I don't think it's from not tightening them tightly enough the first time around as it seemed to loosen up over time (maybe from moving it around from room to room?). Regardless, it's not comforting to have to worry about whether or not it's sturdy.6. I wish the infant insert was secured to the high chair in some way other than being velcroed to the seat platform. Not to mention, the infant insert has 3 big holes in it (for the straps to go through) so food falls down the holes constantly and eventually makes its way to the velcro, rendering it less sticky.7. Although the tray almost looks like it could be reversible, it can only be inserted one way and have it lock (my nanny was using it for several days upside-down before she realized it - she'd just thought the locking mechanism had broken).8. I didn't realize as a first time parent how convenient it would be to have a more mobile high chair - especially one with wheels. This one is on the heavy side. I can still lift and move from one room to another with one arm while holding baby, it's just not something I like to do often.What I do like:1. Infant insert is super comfy. For as many complaints as I have about it, he does seem to be very comfortable in this chair.2. The insert itself is very easy to clean by wiping down with a wet washcloth. (Food falling through the holes is a different matter.)3. Removable plastic tray is very convenient to clean and seems to be holding up well.4. I like the way it looks (mahogany + lime).Overall, it's not something I'd recommend or buy again, but it's not so horrid that I'm planning to get rid of it either.", "review_id": "R2VWP3Q13F1TTL", "asin": "B01MA4PJ6U", "proba": "82.78%", "product_name": "Keekaroo Height Right High Chair Mahogany with Black Infant Insert and Tray"}, {"id": 571, "title": "Handle release strap broken when received", "review": "The handle release strap was half broken when received.

Ooops, that didn't work. there are handles on the side of the chair that you raise up to fold the front and back flaps of the bottom of the chair for easy storage but for some odd reason the flaps would not fold.

You're essentially using a clamp-type mount on the bike's seat tube frame (not on the seatpost, but rather the frame). The mount is securely held in place by four bolts you tighten with an Allen wrench (included).The Peg Perego has an excellent design on the mount allowing for all types of sized frame posts directly addressing the issue I encountered with the other two seats. Included with the Eggy are two different size (lengths) bolts, three different frame post guides, and an articulating frame post mount (metal clamp). These pieces kind of all fit together like a sandwich and the bolts hold everything snug to the frame. It's truly an excellent design and even my wide frame on my bike presented no problem.\u25baInstallation:The core of the installation process is really getting the mounting bracket installed securely on the frame of the bike. Once you've identified the correct components to use - the bolts and frame post guides - it's easy to tighten everything down. My only advice here is to tighten each of the four bolts a bit at a time to ensure everything tightens at the same time and you don't misalign the bolts or seat.The Eggy features a bracket with two heavy-duty metal arms that have a plastic mount that slides into the seat bottom. A plastic pin slides through all this and holds the position of the seat. There is plenty of room to slide the seat back and forth on along the seat bottom bracket. The metal arms slip around the frame and slide into the mount and clamp in place. That's the brunt of the installation!I will say that the instructions aren't great but not terrible either. Some of the pictures can be a bit confusing but just spend a few moments going over everything and you should get the hang of it.--------------------PRODUCT USE:--------------------My son weighs approximately 34lbs (this seat is rated to hold 40lbs) and fits in the seat perfectly. We learned a lot on our first short ride around the neighborhood; some of it good and some not so good. So I'll try to capture everything (included my attempts to address the issues)...\u25baFirst Issue:I initially adjusted the seat further back to give my son a bit more room and so that he could see more than just my back while riding. This however, presented another problem - the seat bottom would touch the top of my rear wheel when encountering any bumps or dips on the ride. This generates a loud grinding sound and more alarmingly the scrape occurs on the plastic locking pin. I was worried that with continued contact the locking pin would disengage allowing the seat to slide on the bracket. So I eventually slid my son closer to me and this seems to take care of the issue for most bumps (although not all) albeit he's very close to my back.\u25baSecond Issue:The seat features deep footwells  that protect the child's legs and feet from coming in contact with the bike. The footwells contain foot rests that slide up and down to accommodate children's height and leg differences. The foot rests have plastic straps that fold over the top of the foot again acting to protect the child from mechanical or moving components on the bike. This works well except for one issue - the footwells  are large and the plastic seems to stick out from my bike frame enough that the heel of my feet strikes a portion of it. I can sort of compensate for the issue by adjusting my feet on the pedal; I've tried pedaling with the middle part of my foot, but this obviously isn't ideal and a huge chore on hills. Initially I though I'd set the mount off-center and one foot-well stuck out more than the other. But even after carefully dismounting the entire seat and mounting everything again the footwells just stick out way too far. The only long-term fix I can think of is to drill two small holes along the bottom of each footwell and use zip ties to hold the footwells up against the chainstay arms on my bike. But this of course doesn't make the seat exactly easy or convenient to slip on and off for rides with and without my son.--------------------THE GOOD:--------------------(+) Price. Compared to the Thule especially this is a good quality seat for the price point and a good value.(+) Mount system. The mount system is versatile and included components for many bike types. Once mounted the seat is firmly in place and secure.(+) Safety Features. The seat offers good wrap-around protection for the child, deep footwells to protect little feet, and a nice big red reflector on the back. Two nylon straps and a child-proof seat buckle round out the safety features.(+) One-Click Installation. Once you've got the mount in place the entire Eggy seat is designed to slip on/off the bike with a push of a button on the mount.--------------------THE BAD:--------------------(-) Seat Clearance. Minimal seat clearance (at least on my bike) means that the seat can come in contact with the rear tire.(-) Footwells. The footwells stick out from the bike frame and can lead to a situation where the riders heel/foot strikes the footwell. Idealy there would be an easy way (built-in) to strap the footwell to the bike frame preventing this issue.--------------------CLOSING:--------------------Unfortunately the two issues with the Eggy are pretty serious and prevent easy and repeated use of the seat. I really wanted to like this product a whole lot more especially after trying two other brands that didn't work. This issue may have more to do with my bike and the dimensions of it so it may work better on other bikes.

We wanted to give the same as a gift to my sister, and since this seemed to be the replacement model we felt comfortable with the purchase.  This product is of inferior quality to the older Snugabunny model.  Upon unboxing, every support bar had scratches in the paint that had rusted.  But since that is only cosmetic, I figured we could deal with it.  Plus the paint is brown so the rust isn't very noticeable.  After a lengthy assembly we realized that the recline latch that comes pre-assembled was faulty and would not securely latch, resulting in the cradle having only the forward position which the product's warning stickers say is life threatening for children under 4 months old.  We then tried the motor with a 5 pound sack of flower in the cradle, and it would not swing on the lowest speed and made a horrible grating noise.  It would swing at faster speeds, but would make a horrible clunking noise once it reached speed.  We tried the same with a 25 pound sack of sugar (the max weight for the swing) and got the same result. Disassembly to send it back was time consuming, but the Amazon Prime return UPS pick up was a breeze.

Here's my take after using both for a year.  We had a Tripp Trapp for our older daughter from infancy and liked it.  She was still using it when we had twins, and I really was having trouble justifying the expense of buying two  Tripp Trapps with baby sets and trays which was going to be nearly $800 when all was said and done, so I was looking for a cheaper option. There were also a few things that I wasn't crazy about on the Tripp Trapp and wondered if spending the extra was worth it. I bought two Keekaroos with the infant inserts, and here is my take on how the two compare.1) Construction.  The Keekaroo is nicely made, but really is inferior in quality to the Tripp Trapp.  The wood is much softer on the Keekaroo, it scratches and dents easily.  On closer inspection of the seat and footrest on the Keekaroo, I don't believe these pieces are solid wood.  They seem to be laminate layered, like plywood, not a solid piece with a woodgrain. The Tripp Trapp has no scratches after 4 years of constant use, and the Keekaroo had big places where the varnish is chipped or gone after just weeks.  The parts of the seat and the foot rest and sides of the tray especially, as  the varnish wore off there very quickly.  The bolts also seem to loosen much more easily on the Keekaroo than the Tripp Trapp.  There is no doubt that the walnut finish and wood on the Tripp Trapp looks much more high end and is good  quality furniture; the wood is hard and solid,  there is a clear and pretty wood grain visable, and it is finished beautifully and durably.  In contrast, the tray portion of the Keekaroo (underneath the plastic tray) is made of particle board or some sort of particle board.2)  Tray issue:  I love that the Keekaroo comes with a tray, which the Tripp Trapp does not.  Though we always have the kids at the table with us, it is nice to have the tray when they're little, and not have them smear their food all over the wood table.  The Stokke Table Top is  really overpriced and also does not stick well to wood tables. The plastic take-off top on the Keekaroo is nice to remove and put in the sink.  Good feature.  The Keekaroo tray is not removable with one hand.  I like that the tray keeps them more contained.  One of mine is a little houdini and it helps with the escape attempts.  The Keekaroo tray is small and compact, which has plusses. Others have complained about the size of the tray.  I actually like the size,  but the lip around it is not very high, and one of our twins always swishes her arms about and flings all the food off the sides.  The Tripp Trapp does not come with a tray, which I don't like.  Stokke doesn't make one out of principle, (they only offer the Stokke Table Top, which I think is pretty worthless) but you can purchase after market trays specifically designed to fit the Tripp Trapp  which are good. I have the Play Tray for the Tripp Trapp, which is great (but costs $70).  It is a nice sturdy tray, and is great also for art projects, play doh, etc for older kids.  The lip on that tray is much deeper and the tray is much larger, which has some advantages.  It does take up more room, is heavier, and is harder to fit in the sink (especially if you have a double sink) or drying on the counter. The larger size and deeper lip on the Play Tray does help the sweeping food off issue, though.  There's a little less disaster on the floor with that tray vs the Keekaroo.  The clear version of the Play Tray can get stained over time with food colors, although I suspect the Keekaroo white one can too, although it shows less than the clear.  I wish Stokke would stop their anti-tray policy and at least make it as an option.  People want trays, they're useful.3)  Chair Design.  The Tripp Trapp wins here hands down.  The Keekaroo is a nice looking chair, but there are some things that make it impractical, things  that I didn't realize until owning it.  The three holes in the back of the seat are cute, but one of our twins always puts his arm through them and gets stuck. The legs also jut out in the back causing it to take up much more room and I frequently trip over them when walking around the table.  The Tripp Trapp (though I don't love the aesthetic look of the z shape) is much more practical, and in the end looks fine.  It fits under the table better and you don't trip over it. It's much more compact. The back rails on the Tripp Trapp are easier to clean and there is less surface to get food smeared on it.4)  The infant insert vs Tripp Trapp baby set:  This only comes with the Keekaroo, and is a nice feature for young babies.  You really can sit them in it nicely even when they aren't sitting up very steadily. It holds them a little like a Bumbo (though not quite as secure). I used it from when they were 5 or 6 months and it worked well to keep them in and steady.  Things I don't like:  It is TERRIBLE to clean.  All the food goes down in the little holes in the infant inserts where the straps pull through. The straps also fall down in the little holes and are difficult to pull out. I did have moderate success fixing this with a big safety pin, but it still slipped down).  When they start eating finger foods we'd end up with pieces of pancake, green beans, everything it seemed, jammed down in the holes for the straps, and I hated it.  They really need to make it a solid piece and figure out some other way for straps to attach another way.  I eventually gave up and used it without the infant insert, flipping the seat over so they weren't sitting on the velcro and reversing the straps.  One of my twins is tiny and could always crawl out even with the straps without the infant insert, and sometimes with it.  I tried to order a new seat piece (the model that doesn't have the infant insert) but the manufacturer (though helpful) will not sell that, citing safety reasons. (I don't why it would be unsafe to switch out the seat to the different style....It is my understanding that the chairs are otherwise the same.)  So once you buy the model with the infant insert, you can't switch to the other, FYI.  The infant insert is big, though. Even my three year old could sit in the chair with it (although I wouldn't use it that way, but just for size comparison)  I really feel that the straps aren't adequate with the infant insert, though.  They sit very low and don't hold the baby adequately in my opinion.  I saw one photo where someone put the straps through those little holes in the back of the seat.  This isn't in the manufacturer's photo, but that seems like a good idea, if they will extend long enough.  I also feel that velcro is also not a sturdy enough way to attach the infant insert.  Also, you need to reverse the seat and straps if you want to use it without the insert, to avoid the baby sitting on velcro.  wasn't completely happy with the baby set from Tripp Trapp either, although it's not bad.  It was a little difficult to assemble, and the babies need to be sitting up more steadily.  All in all, it's ok though.  Not diifficult to clean. Chubby bigger babies may have a harder time getting into it as they get a little older. My biggest complaint was it's cost, which seems excessive for what it is.5) Straps: The Keekaroo straps are ok but not great.  They don't go up very high or around their waists as they're only attached from the bottom of the seat, so I found they didn't contain the kids extremely well, especially if you have a skinny little one who likes to climb.  It was only a problem for one of my twins.  The Tripp Trapp straps (5 point harness) are better, could be improved too, although they have improved them in the later models vs the older one.  The Keekaroo straps are easy to remove and wash.  The Tripp Trapps you have to unscrew and uninstall in order  to wash.  The way the straps click and attach is better on the Tripp Trapp. You can use the Tripp Trapp straps without the five point harness, which is a bit difficult to fit, and gets dirty. They do get tangled. I usually just fasten the bottom part.6) Cleaning:  The Tripp Trapp wins hands down.  The Keekaroo is a pain to clean.  With two babies eating three meals a day, we clean a lot.  For some reason the finish doesn't wipe clean as well (softer wood and low quality varnish?) and the nooks and crannies are definitely much worse to clean.  The Tripp Trapp is very easy to clean. As I mentioned earlier, the infant insert is a bear to keep clean, and so much so that I hated to use it.So - what would I do if I had to buy again?  I actually ended up selling my Keekaroo's on Craig's list and buying two more Tripp Trapps I found on sale and two play trays (no baby set as my twins are a little older now and don't need it) -  mainly because the cleaning and infant insert was becoming such a problem.  The tripping issue was a pain, but I eventually learned to walk farther around it:) But, then again, my issues are compounded as I have twins, and a older one. If you only have one child and aren't cleaning in triplicate, then it might not bother you so much.  I have friends with one baby and the Keekaroo who aren't bothered by the cleaning and like it just fine.  For me, it just became a deal breaker.  Would I buy the Keekaroo again? I'm not sure. I still think that in its price bracket it's a good chair choice for something wood, table height, one that fits from 6 months to adult, and is affordable.  Will the Keekaroo look good after 5 years?  I doubt it.  My Tripp Trapp that is 4 years old still looks great, and I anticipate it will down the road too.  Both are great to use as adjustable booster chairs which I love. Would I buy the model with the infant insert again?  No.  I haven't tried the other one, but what I would do is buy the regular one, and skip the insert. Or if I thought it would be helpful to try,, I'd buy that separately instead, so I'd have options.  If you buy the model with the infant insert together (though it's cheaper) you can't later get the regular one with the passive crotch restraint without buying a new chair, which I think is better for older babies, and easier to clean.  There are many who can't or don't want to spend the amount of money a Tripp Trapp costs, and the Keekaroo is still a good option. (Although the Keekaroo price is not as cheap as it was.  When I bought my chairs, they were selling for $199 with the infant insert - now they're $239, making the difference between the two brands not as large.  The Tripp Trapp has not risen in price.) I hope Keekaroo reads these reviews, because the chair is a good start. With a little improvement in design and quality it could be great competition for the Tripp Trapp.  If deciding between the two chairs as they are now, and making the decision based on the product and not the pricepoint, I'd choose the Tripp Trapp.I hope this helps those who are debating!", "review_id": "R4J953P036N5O", "asin": "B01MA4PJ6U", "proba": "80.63%", "product_name": "Keekaroo Height Right High Chair Mahogany with Black Infant Insert and Tray"}, {"id": 595, "title": "BROKEN Right out of the BOX.

I am also using the Nextfit Zip convertible car seat, which is outstanding on every level, probably the best in its class.The Liteway stroller has a few bafflingly bad design choices, and I know that Chicco knows better, having made other far superior products. So I am writing this review in the hopes that someone on their staff will take note and make improvements for the next iteration.The worst offender here is the straps. The harness is of the \"put the puzzle together\" variety, which is HORRIBLE. Having to fit the pieces together while trying to prevent a writhing, pissed-off toddler from escaping and running into the street adds completely unnecessary stress to the already taxing lives we moms lead. There is no conceivable advantage to having this type of harness. And, to add insult to injury, the pieces don't click together well, and the plastic loop that you have to fit the longer piece into (with the teeth that clicks into the crotch strap) is inexplicably open on one end, so it sometimes pops out multiple times before you can get it snapped in place. Terrible, terrible, terrible design. There is no excuse for something like this on what is supposed to be a high end product from a top class company. The straps are a total deal breaker for me.The stroller is also about 5 lbs too heavy to call itself \"lite\". It's only a few pounds lighter than the behemoth stroller from the travel system, so it's not really that easy to carry. And they only give a flimsy cloth handle on the side for carrying, instead of the much more useful shoulder strap you see on other strollers in this class.The two-step folding process isn't particularly smooth or easy, and half the time you have to bend down and manually push the latching mechanism into place or else the thing will pop back open again. Again, this is an unnecessary extra step to have to take when you are trying to also wrangle a toddler.There is also no conceivable reason why this was constructed to have a 40lb weight limit. Other strollers in this class have much higher weight limits and are not heavier or bulkier as a result. So there's no excuse for it to have such a limited useful life.Finally, the flimsy cloth hood is really sub-par. It should be a nice UV-treated nylon with a peek-through window or mesh, like they have on the travel system.It's too bad that this product has so many major flaws, because there's alot about it that they got right. The seating area is nicely padded, and seems more comfortable than other strollers of this type. Overall the thing feels sturdy and well made, and it handles nicely. I also appreciate the fact that the seat bed lies completely flat, which is a nice feature even for an older baby like mine. He's now almost 17 mos and he still likes to lie down and relax. It's also really nice-looking, like all the other Chicco products, and the cupholder is a particularly handy size. All it needs to be perfect are a one-click harness system, one-step folding mechanism, a better hood, and to lose 5lbs.Chicco usually makes fantastic products, but in my opinion they made some unacceptably poor design choices on this stroller, so I hope they come out with a revised version that is more thoughtfully crafted with ease of use in mind.", "review_id": "R3N7EF9PRPSX1O", "asin": "B01BWNCOIO", "proba": "78.13%", "product_name": "Chicco Liteway Stroller, Almond"}, {"id": 611, "title": "Crib okay, Customer Service AWFUL", "review": "Do yourself a favor and buy a comparable crib from a different company.

He did tummy time, floor time, and was held a lot also.  He is 6 months old now and has been in a helmet for the past 5 weeks to treat a severe flat spot caused by positioning.  I did not know until it was too late that flat spots are not just caused from sleeping on their backs, but the car seat, swing, and this sleeper are far worse than the crib!  Being a first time Mom, I had no idea the harm I was causing.I did love the convenience of this--easy to move from room to room, and it folds small so you can take it with you wherever you go.  I have a small house so the size of this was perfect--no large pack n play to have to move around and fit into a small space.  My son still takes naps in it and occasionally sleeps the night in it (he is in a helmet now, so I figure it can't cause any more harm).  If I have another child though, this will not be used.My baby will be in a helmet now for at least 6 months to get his head near the normal range.  Beware and be careful!  The convenience of this is not worth the inconvenience and strain on the baby that it causes.Added to original review 4/25/2011:My son is now a year old and still has a flat spot, even after 8 months of wearing the helmet.  He will always have a flat spot, hopefully less noticable as he gets older.  The neuro-surgean said that his flat spot was the worst she had ever seen.  The improvement from the helmet is there, but since he started so severe, we just can't get it back into the \"normal\" range for head shape!  I can't tell you how much I regret using this rocker.

We used a Chicco for my boy, and while it was really good, we werent happy with how the seat and strap covers cracked.  We ordered this chair for my daughter with the infant insert and tray combo, and it is the insert that was the problem..The assembly went well, but the infant seat was difficult to put on the chair.  There are straps that extend down to a bar under the chair that connect to the infant seat.  These are tight, probably by design, but the only thing holding the front of the seat down were big squares of Velcro.  The Velcro was already attached to the chair, and to assemble, the instructions have you place the soft part of the Velcro on the seat, pull the adhesive and place the seat.  The back of the infant seat slips under the wooden back of the chair, so you have to wedge it underneath.There are a couple of problems with this.  Once you put down the seat on the Velcro, you cant (or shouldnt) move it.  Secondly, where the Velcro was placed, the straps went through the middle.  The seat didnt seem to fit squarely under the back, so the front of the seat rises up in the front.  The seat doesnt stay stuck down because the Velcro doesnt have enough surface area.In hindsight, there are videos on the company's website that show how to install the infant seat.  This might have made placement easier, but I am not so sure it would solved the Velcro problem.Daily usage is also a problem with the infant seat.  There are three holes in the infant seat--one for the front strap and two for each side.  Food always gets down in the holes.  I have to take the seat out just to remove it.  Additionally, food gets caught up in the Velcro. One other thing, that really is just an annoyance, is that it take two hands to remove or put back the tray.  Even thought the Chicco tray was slightly heavier, the design allowed me to manage the tray one-handed.As others mentioned, any bump or scrap shows up on the wood as well, as it is just a veneer.

Why the delay?  The first time we opened the box we found none of the hardware (nuts, bolts, screws etc) had come with the item.  Called the manufacturer and they sent over a plastic bag of nuts and bolts.  Primed and ready to go, I made it to step #2 in the assembly instructions before I realized that they sent SOME of the hardware but left out all the lock washers.  Another call to the manufacturer got me the same embaressed customer service rep who reportedly walked out to the warehouse and watched them pack up an entire new set of hardware to send to me overnight.Finally armed with all the right items, I did the assembly.Some tips for those assembling this crib as the assembly instructions are pretty poorly written and almost vague in places.  Take my experience though with a little grain of salt as I am obviously not putting cribs together on a daily basis:- Step 4 - there is a note about making sure the \"metal post brackets\" are facing inside the crib.  There are probably people better at this than I am, but I had no idea what they were referring to.  Bottom line, what they mean is make sure the legs of the crib are facing with the support holes inside so you can attach the metal spring frame.  Look to make sure on each leg that you can count 4 equally-spaced holed near the bottom of the crib legs such that they face inward.  I learned this the hard way.- Step 6 - They say to attach the cross bar first, then attach the stationary side.  Take my advice, do the the stationary side FIRST then do the cross bar.  I struggled for awhile to get everything to line up with the cross bar first, then realized it was much much easier to install the stationary side and just line up the cross bar afterwards.  Just make sure you leave enough slack in the bolts so you can slide the post on.- Speaking of the slack in the bolts - The instructions say repeatedly to NOT overtighten the bolts.  I made a point of having things snug but not tight.  After I was done I tugged on all the sides and found that even with the bolts fairly snug the pieces moved around a bit.  It made me feel uncomfortable that when my baby girl starts to get bigger she could actually move stuff.  Once I cranked on the hardware fairly hard though, stuff hung better together and it stopped shifting around.  I might regret this later but I would rather have the crib be more secure than less.The actual crib looks good and it feels of decent quality.  I can definitely see some of the soft finish that others have talked about so hopefully it wont prove to be a problem later on.So in summary, here's all the scores out of a possible 5 stars:Quality:  3 (decent heft, poor finish)Customer Service:  2 (sorry, but it shouldnt take me 2 calls to get the hardware to put this thing together)Color:  4 (the White looks very good)Instructions:  2Price:  5 (I saw a similiar crib at pottery barn for kids selling for $1000)Overall: 3Best to all the new parents out there and wish me luck!

I was counting on being able to buy the toddler rails and a crib conversion kit for it in order to use it beyond its time as a traditional crib.  After a visit to the DaVinci site, I discovered that this crib does not have any coordinating toddler rails or a conversion kit with matching side rails to go with it.  Everything the company produces for its 3-in-1 cribs in toddler rails and side rails is in the traditional colors:  white, ebony, cherry, etc.  This explains why I couldn't locate these products anywhere in Amazon's catalog nor on the company's page.  I'm really disappointed since I had my heart set on using this as a crib and then a toddler bed.  If you read DaVinci's product description for it you will see that while they call it a 3-in-1, they only indicate that it can be used as a crib and daybed.  This means the stationary side rail can be removed, but it doesn't do anybody who wants matching parts to make it a toddler bed or a crib with a conversion side rail any good.  I'm really miffed that the product's title makes it sound like the consumer can get something that doesn't exist.  A more apt name for this would be a 2-in-1 crib.:(  Caveat emptor.UPDATE:  The crib has held up well structurally for a baby who has slept in it every night for about the past nine months and a big sister who slept in it before from about age two to almost age three.  It is easy to assemble and disassemble.  (This comes from my mechanical engineer husband.  He is not only incredibly handy, but he has patents, so he knows his stuff.)  We have taken it apart and reassembled it a few times.  However, the wood is soft.  Therefore, it is prone to dings and dents.  We have treated ours very gently and avoided damage from moving, but my teething baby managed to put some  marks in the wood at the highest points on the headboard and footboard.  (We have kept the side rails covered with protectors, otherwise I am sure they would look like gnawed on corncobs by now.)  One concern is that not only did my baby gnaw on the wood, but she easily ate off the paint.  I certainly hope it is water-based.  It appeared to be that way because I caught her in the act of chewing, picked her up immediately, and wiped blue drool right off her chin.  There were no stains on her skin, so I hope that is a good sign!  I am now going to add covers to the headboard and footboard, which I should have done to start with--more to protect my baby from eating wood and paint than to preserve the crib. :)", "review_id": "R3P69UKPLQOT0J", "asin": "B019MYBUNK", "proba": "73.38%", "product_name": "DaVinci Jenny Lind 3-in-1 Convertible Crib, Fog Grey"}, {"id": 662, "title": "Broken!", "review": "When we opened the box to put the crib together, the metal part that holds the mattress was broken.

The mattress frame that came with our crib doesn't lay flat.  It either tilts to one side or the other.  At first I assumed it was because I was inverting the frame to make it sit higher, but I just flipped the frame today and it STILL doesn't lay flat.  At first, it wasn't a big deal, I just manually leveled the frame myself.  However, now that my son is heavier (16 pounds) and rolling over constantly, he's starting to tilt the mattress himself and face plant into the bars.  Since it is WELL past any return date, we are stuck either drilling wider holes to compensate or getting another crib.  NOT HAPPY.  I also do not feel this pine wood is sturdy enough to withstand an enthusiastic toddler... it wobbles.  If you were thinking of side-carring your crib, forget it.  WIthout the fourth side, it feels like it will snap any second.This is a beautiful, sturdy, solid wood crib, and it looks just lovely.  The wood is a nice, light color, and there was no chemical off-gassing smell at all!  Only a slight wood and oil smell.  Putting it together was quick and easy, although the pieces weren't labeled, so I had to do some \"educated guessing\" on which parts were which.  It was fairly easy, once I set out the parts.  I really liked the way the bolts came prepackaged, so there was no question about which to use.  The two, top side rails had a slight chip at their narrowest tips, but I think that's inevitable when shipping such soft wood.  The mattress is useless; you will need a real one.  For the price, I wasn't expecting a real mattress anyway.  I'm only docking one star because I'm not too happy with the spring bottom.  It attaches to the wooden crib via these weird metal arms.  As another reviewer noted, the only way to get the crib set up at it's highest (newborn) level is to invert these metal swing-arms.  So the crib is basically balanced on these 4, angled arms.  (Maybe they don't want you setting the crib that high, but many of the manufacturer's pics show it that way, so I think those holes should be drilled).  At any rate, that's still not my biggest gripe.  I don't like how the mattress (at normal levels) HANGS from these metal arms, and there's a metal dowel to keep it from over extending.  If you've got a thin mattress, and a toddler stuck his hand down there while bouncing, I think that could be a pinched finger waiting to happen.  I'm no crib expert, honestly, and maybe there's a reason, but I think I would rather have the spring board attach directly to the frame itself.  Also, it's a minor gripe, but the crib came covered in large manufacturing and warning stickers, and I wish the manufacturer would use a glue that was a little easier to remove.", "review_id": "R3ADGGASIAUFTT", "asin": "B01BQLOSV8", "proba": "72.75%", "product_name": "Dream On Me Aden Convertible 4-in-1 Mini Crib, Grey"}, {"id": 667, "title": "I have SUCH a LOVE-HATE relationship with this thing", "review": "I use this high chair 3-4 times per day, just about every day.

My baby got the skin of his thumb caught in the insert holes between the tray and the chair -- before you judge me and think that I just wasn't paying attention, you should really attempt to put a squirmy baby into this thing -- the pinch happened so fast and he wailed but was ultimately fine, and though it was just a small pinch, we have practiced \"hands up\" every time I put in the tray.-to put the tray into the chair, you have to insert your fingers into a pull that is located in the center front of the tray.  In doing so, my mom and I both pinched our fingers in that part.-the double-layer system, while great in theory, has a lip on the bottom part of the tray that food always gets trapped in, so you have to clean that part off anyway-cleaning the straps is a project -- the kid gets goop all over the straps and you have to remove them with a screw driver and soak in hot water with Dawn detergent to really get them clean, especially when the kid is still putting everything into his mouth-cleaning food out of some of the crevices of this thing is also irritatingOverall, we're satisfied with this chair because the baby likes being in it, but we all have to be cautious every time we use it and think the tray could use a serious redesign.  For the cost, this should be a 100% aggravation-free product, I feel.UPDATE:  I wrote this review about a year and a half ago, but my sentiments still stand.

I wanted to only spend a certain amount for a lightweight stroller (about $100 or less), but still have some conveniences like the under carriage basket, easy recline, and lightweight. After looking around I decided on this and once it finally arrived - estimated up to 2 months wait, but received well within one month - I was super excited.Set up was easy as I only had to snap in the front wheels - less than 2 minutes to set up. Folding out seemed fairly easy and LO seemed comfortable as I first set her in there.  I didn't take close notice that the product received did not quite match the advertised picture. See the pic I uploaded. As you see, the canopy shade is actually yellow, and the flap in back of the shade is black. Also the straps are colored black. I actually was fine with this reverse in coloring instead. The under carriage seemed to be roomy enough to hold small needs. Also the padded back and seat was a good bonus as I wanted to be sure my LO would be comfortable for long seating there. The wheels navigate pretty smoothly over a number of surfaces as well. What I also like is that the canopy can be adjusted to offer adequate shade for her. The stroller handle bars are at a decent height for both me (5'4\") and my husband (5'11\") to push with being hunched over. Reclining was pretty easy with the strap loosening in back. I would have preferred a handle bar where you lift and adjust in increments instead.Now that I have used it for a few months I noticed a few issues. First and most important is the weight. I really got this because it was advertised as 7 lbs. As some other reviewers noted it is NOT 7 lbs, but more like 12. That extra 5 lbs makes a huge difference if you have it collapsed AND your holding your child. Which was an unfortunate, painful experience as I had to do exactly that when changing planes for a recent vacation. Also, folding down and opening is easier with two hands versus one hand as advertised. It took me some tries to get the hang of releasing the pedal to activate the release, then folding down. Similarly with opening, there's a hook you have to disengage on the side and then pull open with either your foot or by hand. I also noticed the front part of the seat slopes over time with her sitting there. Granted my LO likes to sit in it slumped down and to the side, but the seat sloping didn't help with how she was sitting. I also noticed the advertised picture looks like it would have had a padded 'lip' where her legs would dangle. That part of the picture I wish was what I received. Also, the straps seemed to be cutting into her leg. While she didn't complain, I would have preferred some more security and comfort for her. I plan on putting a Velcro padding around the center part to hopefully combat that. However, I think that's an extra purchase I should not have to make for the price.If I had to purchase a lightweight stroller again, I'd probably go with the Summer Infant 3D lightweight stroller instead. I was contemplating that and that was actually a bit less expensive than this brand. I decided on this one solely on the advertised weight, but realize I would have gotten the same (with weight) with my other planned choice. (For your reference, LO is slightly small for her age - lean, but long, weighed 20 lbs and is now 15 months old.

When we place the car seat in the front facing us, our 3 yr old sits in the back facing out but his legs don't fit. He gets tired and then his legs hang making it dangerous as they touch the ground. The seat must be 90 degrees upright or else his head hits the back of the car seat. When the car seat is front facing closes position to the handle, the baby's feet are sticking under the handle which makes it uncomfortable for him and difficult for us to remove the seat. The car seat doesn't fit securely in the front click connect and becomes dislodged easily which is very dangerous.  In addition, when the car seat is in the front click connect, the seat towards the front is mostly blocked making it unusable for the other child who must stand.  For all these reasons this stroller is a huge disappointment and mostly unusable for us. The only attribute that is good is its ability to fold/unfold easily.

I chose this crib partly because of the Graco name, but also because I loved the idea that I wouldn't have to purchase another bed for my daughter for a very long time. She is now 18 months old and I'm ready to convert the crib to a toddler bed. Pfft....this crib, although it's advertised as such, doesn't actually convert to a toddler bed.I called Graco to ask them about it and they informed me they couldn't help me because they didn't manufacture the crib. That in itself really upset me. They gave me the number to LaJobi. First off, the woman I spoke with at LaJobi was extremely rude. When I asked her about converting the crib to a toddler bed, she informed me that I just need to remove the front panel of the crib. I responded by telling her that was what a daybed is...I wanted to know about the toddler bed. She then informs me that the two beds are the exact same -- the only difference is the mattress position. With the toddler bed, the mattress is on the lowest setting whereas on the daybed, it's on the middle setting. That's when my anger got even stronger. They are marketing this crib as a crib, toddler bed, day bed, and full sized bed when in reality it's a crib, day bed with 2 choices for mattress settings, and a full sized bed.I then inquired on what to do about side guard rails to help prevent my daughter from falling off the bed when she's asleep. The woman then proceeded to tell me that guard rails are not designed for the child's safety. She said that all guard rails are designed to keep the mattress on the frame. Wow. Does she really think people are that stupid?After explaining all of this to Babies R Us where I purchased the crib, they very graciously allowed me to return it for a full refund in store credit to purchase a normal toddler bed and get away from this nightmare of a crib.Please just avoid this crib all together.", "review_id": "R2KAUR72I75TJI", "asin": "B01KH78OA8", "proba": "67.82%", "product_name": "Graco Lauren 4-in-1 Convertible Crib, Black"}, {"id": 715, "title": "My kids are comfortable though.

My wife wanted the Bugaboo and I showed up with the Recaro Denali. I saw it on line, looked at the video and thought Recaro is a reputable company, I can't go wrong. Now maybe I got a defective unit and I plan on contacting Recaro in the morning, but in comparison to several other stroller systems available, I'd say this one is poorly designed. I won't say cheaply designed, but it does come to mind.There are a lot of features and it does fold and unfold with ease most of the time, but those are the only highs. The stroller does not turn on a dime nor is it as maneuverable as some of the other 4 wheeled strollers available. With less than 3 months of use the rubber wheels are wearing down. The sliding mechanism that allows the stroller to fold works well, most of the time, but there are days when it does not slide smoothly, so the chair does not fold as easily as it does on other days. The storage on the bottom of the stroller is nice, but very difficult to access, especially with the cars seat in place. The shade system on the car seat is not the best. Being honest, it's cheap...It looks nice but its starts to pull and does not retract evenly. The car seat is not the lightest on the market and I end up having to lug it around because its too heavy for my wife. The cloth lining in the care seat is very attractive and its one of the high points, but it is very difficut to clean. As a matter of fact you have to be very patient to remove the seat lining and putting it back together is even a greater pain... These are bothersome issues, but I can live with them. Quite honestly, I was trying not to admit to my wife that we should have purchased another system.I finally got fed up today when the release on the back of the seat failed... there is a plastic handle that releases the car seat from the stroller and the base. At times we would have to jiggle the car seat back and forth to get it to release but now the lever has completely stopped working. So now the car seat will not release from the car seat base. If it had failed while attached to the stroller, the car seat would be stuck on the stroller...Since the car seat would not separate from the base, I had to remove the car seat and base together, and take them into a restaurant as a single unit. Very embarrassing, not to mention very heavy... I figured, I'd get home and jiggle the seat on the base and get it to release, well it wouldn't... The releasing mechanism /handle is not working at all. I took the fabric off to inspect the car seat further to find that the Styrofoam has separated from the seat. It appears to have been held in place by a few dabs of glue (cheap).The car seat and stroller were purchased new from Recaro through amazon, and I must say I am highly disappointed with this purchase. This is our first child and my wife told me not to skimp and go with a company that has a stronger reputation in the car seat / stroller industry and after all of this, I think she was right. Unfortunately, I waited too long to return the stroller and car seat, so I'm contacting Recaro in the morning to see what they are willing to do to make things right.Keep in mind that in an emergency situation if the seat won't release from the stroller or from the base, you better be quick in getting the harness off your child and getting him/her out of the car seat.In Recaro's defense, I'm pretty sure I purchased one of the first units produced so maybe this was a defective unit. But as a local stroller retailer told us, \"Recaro's Denali system is brand new and unproven. I'd be cautious with purchasing something for my child's safety that's new on the market.\"", "review_id": "R50R9254C8S8", "asin": "B00UVW4J1I", "proba": "66.82%", "product_name": "RECARO Performance Denali Stroller, Safari"}, {"id": 720, "title": "... car seat through the airport and we needed a good travel stroller", "review": "We bought this product after reading all of the positive reviews as we needed a way to get the car seat through the airport and we needed a good travel stroller.

The child straps adjust very easily so we can use the stroller for our toddler or our 9 mos old by quickly adjusting the straps.Our stroller was broken right from the start--a small metal piece was bent but that caused the webbing attach to it to fall off which in turn resulted in half of the seatback being unsupported when in an upright position. Fortunately, we were still able to use the stroller though we did have to gerryrig it.I met another family who had the same stroller. She had to have her stroller replaced because the storage part underneath had broken shortly after she got hers.

He's about 20lbs and 30-inches tall. I fit the iBert to a Medium Specialized Globe Centrum singlespeed. I bought the iBert mostly based on reviews at Amazon saying that it wouldn't hit my knees.Installation was easy, but you need about 3/4-inch of steer tube exposed for the bar to attach to. I had just enough. I found that regardless of how tight I clamped the bolts down, the bar is easily moved off center with a little push. During our ride, the seat moved about an inch to the side. It didn't affect the ride, but looked weird to me mostly.The reviews on Amazon are pretty ecstatic. But as a former bike mechanic, I found the mechanism just \"so-so\" in terms of stability and design. The thing wobbles once the seat is attached; the interface between the support bar and the seat itself isn't very tight, so there is quite a bit of play, but I don't think it's really noticeable once the child is on the seat.Since the seat is attached to your steer tube, it does add a little weight to the steering of the bike.While riding, my knees did hit the sides of the seat, but because the plastic is very smooth, they just slid by and it wasn't very noticeable to me. My wife said I looked funny pedaling, though, so I must have been splaying my knees outward.The main issue I had was that there is not enough clearance between the back of the seat and my saddle's nose. I could barely squeeze between the two (and I'm considered \"thin\").  Squeezing in between is necessary to get started pedaling on the bike and it's a little tricky to get started going. I've just ordered a seatpost with a little more setback to see if that gives me another inch to play with. The other thing is that you can't get out of the saddle to climb; you will hit the back of his head and seat.The seat itself is just a hunk of plastic. Not much to say about it. He had no issues fitting into it, but the straps aren't exactly securing; they were pretty loose no mater how I adjusted them. On the way back from our 14-mile total ride I looked down and his head was all flopped over! He fell asleep! I felt bad for him to have his neck like that and wondered if I should have bought the Kangaroo seat instead which has a built-in rest.I don't know if there really is a \"perfect\" seat out there that solves the knee and clearance issues as well as provides a safe and secure ride for the child, but for now the iBert seems just about as good as any of the other options.", "review_id": "R22OASREXG20OR", "asin": "B000H4E7EO", "proba": "66.49%", "product_name": "iBert Child Bicycle Safe-T-Seat"}, {"id": 725, "title": "Good once on, but pain to get on.", "review": "Functions exactly the way you would want it to once you get it on but there's one problem, it's a pain to slide it on the rack after the rack is mounted.

I'll do an overview of good and bad.Good: The only good thing is that it looks nice.Bad: 1. There is fabric under the seat cushions. FABRIC. Clearly a person with children did not design this chair. You have to take the cushions off every time and soap up and clean the fabric that has soaked up all the spilled milk and yogurt and captured all the crumbs from little hands that work their way easily in between the plastic and the back of the cushion...that is fabric. Did I mention that? And if you wanted to forgo the cushions to save yourself some cleaning time you can't really do that because of the next item in the list...it would make the chair incredibly uncomfortable unless the child was fully clothed in a fabric that didn't stick.2. The awesome fabric on the back of the cushions sticks to the plastic chair with VELCRO??? Which after a few months stops working because it is so incredibly filled with bits of food that stink and pieces of sponge from your worthless attempts to clean out the stinky food.3. Do not attempt to rinse off the tray. Even when the edges where the two pieces of plastic meet are filled with guacamole. Do not attempt to wash it. Why? Because It will fill with water and slowly drip out this water which somehow also becomes stinky (I'm assuming there is mold growing in there but I'm too afraid to unscrew all the tiny screws to find out) all over the floor and your child next time you go to use the tray.4. The center strap and buckle are not removeable. So you cannot wash them. And the little buckle is forever filled with food. That you cannot clean out...and it stinks. Along with the strap...which has also soaked up said milk and yogurt and tuna juice or whatever else.5. There are a remarkable number of nooks and crannies in this chair. It's as if they designed it to trap babies arms between the seat and arm rests, plus the places where the plastic meet the wood on the side are always filled with crumbs.Ok I could go on but I've picked the top 5 annoying things about this chair. I am not a dirty person and I am not a clean freak either. Just a mom with a normal messy kid who is doing her best to keep things clean enough that they don't stink. This is quite impossible with this chair. Save your money and get the cheap $30 all plastic high chair from ikea...it doesn't look as good as this chair but it is so practical and easy to clean it's a way better choice.I have twins on the way so I'm going to consign this chair and get three ikea chairs!

The problem is that it clicks and in such a way that if your baby pulls a toy towards himself the bar is unseated and it is really easy for even a gentle tug to cause it to fall onto the baby. If that is not bad enough, the worst feature of this bouncer is that the battery pack is located right where a baby kicks. My kid has very active legs. He is three and a half month old and 25 inches 14 pounds. He is barely started to become active in general. He loves the bouncer, because he loves to kick and move. But because of the placement of the battery pack when he kicks down his heels slam into the hard surface of the battery (see picture). I have found bruising on his heels.

The bouncer also only sits up fairly far, where it would be nice if it laid back more.or better yet, that it offered options on the bouncer incline level.We mostly use it in the soothing position (up high, but laid back). We LOVE being able to place the baby in a higher position. This position helps us keep the baby engaged with us during meals or while I am working in the kitchen. This worked especially well until the soother stopped working only about a week after receiving the product. Now the soother just makes noise, but does not vibrate. (No, it isn't the batteries...we replaced those, just in case!)  The music still works and the songs are pleasant, but I would expect a much better lifespan for the soother than 1 week!The straps are a little tricky. I'm not sure why they had to make them so complicated to fit together and the hard plastic makes loud clicks when you buckle them. (Why do they do this with products for babies...how about a softer material that won't startle baby awake?)  It is possible to minimize the click noise if you slowly depress the buttons a little as you go to connect them.It would be nice if the features could be used in the various positions.  For example, the bouncer can only be used low...and the \"theoretical\" soother cannot be used while the baby is sitting up. It would be nice to be able to use the soother in any mode, if the soother still worked..or the bouncer in any mode, too.The bar that toys can hang from is also flimsy. It doesn't actually stay up well in some of the lower positions because the (very lightweight) toys are too heavy. It is very far away, too...far enough away that I hope our baby never develops arms long enough to actually reach them (ha ha). The bar also started popping off easily on one side after about two weeks.The biggest concern is that there is a release in the back to lower the seat from high seat/soother to bouncer position or collapse it for storage. Supposedly, for safety reasons, the release has two mechanisms, push down and pull out. My 4 year old stood on the back of the chair to see her brother better and I noticed she stepped right in the release. She hasn't done it since, but I tested it and just stepping on the release collapsed the seat (no baby in it that time, but it is certainly a concern if it's that easy to collapse). It is nice to have a product that folds up completely, but it's not worth it if it is that easy to accidentally collapse it with the baby inside.It also seems pretty sturdy and it's not easy to tip over, but while I was in another room my two-year-old tipped the whole thing over. I don't know how she did it and I would never leave the baby in the seat while I am not in the room, but she did tip it and she can't tip our high chair of a similar height. This would also be a concern with a large dog possibly running into it. As a family with a couple of English Mastiffs, this is always a consideration.The seat is extremely easy to assemble, the fabric washes well and the colors are beautiful and appealing.

so u push the button guess what it pops out both sides so you are back at square one in this battle... and by the time u get both babies safely strapped in this process of battle could take more than 8 mins... something you thought that was suppose to make things easier and safer.... does that sound easier spending 4 times longer just trying to get my baby strapped in properly? nope so i gave up on top straps which is really disappointing.4. fully removable tray with one hand and tray liner i give this 3 and half stars yes the tray is removable with one hand but its also very heavy first day we had it i didnt get the tray click locked and the boys knocked it off had it falled off on one of them it could have seriously hurt them also not easy on my grandmothers wrist that has arthtits i do like that the tray is nice and wide and big plenty of space for the rubber place mat plates the cup holder is a joke its less than a half inch deep doesnt offer a cup any kind of support and doesnt hold very much snacks at all then the tray part isnt removable with one hand and its not really easy to get off or on my grandma cant do it its hard snap on and off i also dont like that there isnt any way to lay these tray flat i mean your going to get your baby out so u take the tray liner out sit it on the cabinet so u can turn the big turn up side down for it to have flat area... but if u didnt clean it your counter tops just got dirty my bigger issue is though i have two of these high chairs so to unsnap both tray liner and put these huge tray well my sink and my cabinets cant hold all 4 seperated there just isnt enough room and my twins are not going to let me clean one before i get the other kid down so if these trys laid flat and kept all the mess in the tray i could put one in the sink and one on the cabinet ...but worse part is this thing has like 6 tray adjustments yet on number 1 there is almost 3inch gap between my baby isnt the tray suppose to be with  in 1 inch the closer the tray the less the mess and the closer the food is to the mouth so the less engery and effort it takes and the better sucess you at teaching self feeding early on? and this 3 inch gap is with the seat sitting straight up at its most forward point  the chair did come with that little grey cushion that may have helped them half inch more forward but that cushion isnt wipe off material it absorbs, milk, snot,spit up, and stage 2 baby food stains i would have to hand wash these daily and wash twice a week to keep the smell downnumber 5 ability to move high chair around with ease with kid in and with child pushing it him self this chair gets no stars on it the wheels on this chair is almost a deal breaker they are seriously almost enough to make me post mine for sell to try to find a chair that better fits my needs but i just spent $500 on these i wouldnt get even close trying to sell used high chairs no matter the price i paid or condition....why they get zero stars for ability to move because the front wheels DO NOT TURN you cannot rotate your child slightly this way no if you are in front of him the only option you have is to push farther away from you or litterly lift up the front wheels off the floor with your kid in the chair because you cant just grab the trey and pull any way because no these wheels have some super rubbery gripper texture they dont slide only roll front and back and u cant grab the trey to lift up its not attached to the high chair sturdy enough to lift the front end and the kid in it so u have to grab the front bars the chair slides up and down on if you want to roate your kid that or you walk behind the babies and pull one baby 6 ft away from his twin and he starts screaming thinking your taking him away from his twin and hes not done eating just so u can make the back wheels swivle the front in the  right little slight turn u wanted it to make and then look you upset both twins because the front wheels dont turn... also very much a pain when your trying to seat them at the table u need to have like 6 ft area to line them up at your table to get them to the right angle you want or you will be lifting that front end from behindwe have tile floor our old high chair that had no wheels my boys pushed around every where we dont fold them up we push them against a certain wall when its not meal time and also the back wheel breaks... thats a joke too it doesnt stop the wheels from swiveling it simply doesnt allow those to turn but guess what there is not traction on those cheap wheels that are like on the bottom of rolly cart so even with those wheels locked my child can get excited and bounce in his chair and make it roll or my other son can push the chair with his brother in it so those breaks useless and pointless just for looksthen if we ever do make it to the point of useing the big kid stool seat theres no strap on it at all i get 6 yrs old wont need straps but if you have a mature 3 yr old that wants to be big girl but u want piece of mind ... u put options straps on the seat that are removable!!! then there is no storage on this high chair to put that booster or anything else idk if your like me but if it cant keep attached to what it came with it gets lost!so if this had been the high chairs i got a baby shower it would probly be worn down by now and it would have never made it to all these points of use and issues and that big kid stool would have never even been on the post to seen the light and get used i maybe maybe could have liked as a baby naper  and recline chair u feed babies in but toddler high chair this fails... very disappointed.", "review_id": "R26UGMDMF7L7IH", "asin": "B01N02YU88", "proba": "62.48%", "product_name": "Chicco Progress Relax Multichair, Genesis"}, {"id": 765, "title": "Three Stars", "review": "a wheel broke", "review_id": "RXI2LO0AQUBBV", "asin": "B013PBBBXK", "proba": "62.38%", "product_name": "Dream On Me Classic 2 in 1 Convertible Stationary Side Crib, Cherry and 4\" Full Size Foam Crib and Toddler Bed Mattress"}, {"id": 766, "title": "A solid product for the price", "review": "My one year old is entertained by this for a few minutes at a time.

It's already really noisy to turn on and startles the baby with the clicking and grinding noises (which I try to drown out with the music before turning on the swing). Fast forward to day 33: The head to toe motion on the right swivel does not work - at all. The head to toe on left swivel works with clicking, dimming lights and music that changes speed. The side to side motion works with dimming lights. I called Fisher Price and explained the problem, they asked for the product number and date code stamped on the motor. It's not really clear and rather hard to read since it's not on a label, it's melted into the plastic...be sure to peel the label off the box and save it.

It's nice to be able to easily move the crib across the wood floors in our nursery for changing sheets but our son pulls himself up on the side of the crib and wiggles his butt,  sending the crib scooting a few feet across the floor.

We wanted a nice looking highchair cause we have small house, and our dining room is where we hang out.  We have a nice dark wood table, and we wanted something that would blend in.  I get so many compliments on how this high chair looks so nice.  Which it does, but.... here's the bad (based on having used the Keekaroo for the last 7 months or so):1.  My daughter gets her fingers stuck sometimes between the removable white tray and the wooden tray.  Which is really her own fault, but she's only 14 months so it's hard to blame her.  It's not going to really mess her up but I wish it was designed differently so the babies couldn't get there little fingers in there.  Also, it's happened before that if she's already sitting in there with the wooden tray, and I snap the white tray on, I pinch her little belly fat roll in the same space.  I'm careful about that now, but kind of annoying that I have to watch out for it.2.  It's kind of a pain to replace the infant booster (sold separately) after cleaning, cause you have to thread the straps through.3.  I know you are never supposed to leave baby unattended... but it happens sometimes, right?  I never leave her in there out of eyesight, but even that makes me worried.  The infant booster only attaches with a little velcro and the pressure of the strapped in baby.  When my daughter is not so happy and leaning way forward, I worry that she might be able to slide the booster off the chair and be sort of trapped (this only happens when the tray is not in place).  Hasn't happened yet. Also, when she's unhappy she can rock the chair!  I don't think she could tip it, but it seems like it's wrong that she can rock it.  She could do this even before she turned one. A five point harness would prevent this.  EDIT July 2013 - turned out I did not have the booster correctly installed, the top is supposed to be behind the back rest, I just had it sitting on the velcro.4.  When she was smaller we'd put a blanket on the back rest so she didn't hit her head too hard on it.  A pillow of some sort would make this look not as nice but in some ways it would be good to have.5.  As noted by others, the wood is definitely showing signs of wear after just 7 months.  Small nicks result in removed finish exposing lighter colored wood.  Especially on the tray where it is inserted (which incidentally, is marginally protected by some cheesy stickers that say, \"don't remove of the wood will scratch!\" - who wants to keep cheesy stickers on a nice highchair?)6.  It also seems like the screws come loose sort of often.  There are (more) stickers that say, \"make sure the screws are in tight\" - don't ignore this advice.7.  There's just too many downsides to justify the price, so I would not recommend this to a friend.  On the other hand, I think I will keep using it for years, and I like the way it will grow with my daughter.", "review_id": "RU0XRJ9UTKRVX", "asin": "B01MDN79AY", "proba": "57.21%", "product_name": "Keekaroo Height Right High Chair Natural with Black Infant Insert and Tray"}, {"id": 820, "title": "After about a month, our phone broke and would ...", "review": "After about a month, our phone broke and would only play the same song over and over on repeat.", "review_id": "R1C23CO3Y7YEKA", "asin": "B06XQ9B54V", "proba": "57.17%", "product_name": "VTech Touch and Swipe Baby Phone"}, {"id": 821, "title": "Came in pieces; horrible customer service", "review": "This product arrived cracked in half.

(Another clue: the magenta logo label was sewn to the inside of the back cover, not the outside where it would be visible when using the Totseat.) We'd inadvertently bought ours from an unauthorized seller on Amazon -- it was called \"Phoenix seller.\"So this one-star review is for the knockoff, but Totseat customer service gets 10 stars. They replied immediately to our message, figured out the problem, and are trying to help us get a genuine Totseat even though we bought this several months ago. Apparently there are knockoffs floating around the internet, and they may be unsafe -- the buckles might not be sturdy/secure enough and there's no guarantee that the fabric or dyes are safe either. Anyway, it's a brilliant product, we're looking forward to using the real one, but I encourage you to be 100% certain that you are buying from an authorized seller/stockist and getting the real deal. If you are at all uncertain, do contact Totseat via totseat.com, they're extraordinarily helpful.", "review_id": "R3APFBD1GUTC07", "asin": "B01DE33WFO", "proba": "55.47%", "product_name": "Totseat Chair Harness: The Original Washable and Squashable, Portable Travel High Chair in Zest"}, {"id": 830, "title": "I'm extremely disappointed as Maclaren did not offer to fix it or ...", "review": "After using this buggy about 10 times the handle broke off (snapped!), while entering a store.

I understand that this may happen as babies start having teeth, but there was so much paint that came off that my husband and I are a little freaked out. I am attempting to reach out to the company to see if there was some cribs that maybe had weaker wood and weren't painted well because the damage done in a merely few minutes seems excessive.

They enjoyed the swinging more than the vibrations. The babies also seem to enjoy the nature sounds. I don't use the music function. The vibrating part gets weaker as the batteries run low. The swing also swings with less force as the batteries run low.After a month it broke. I bought new batteries, but that wasn't the problem. The motor made a sound, but it wouldn't swing. I took the thing apart twice and put it back together. Nothing. I had to call Graco directly because it was past the 30 days that I could contact the online store I bought it from. Graco was very nice and they sent out a replacement motor. It took a week to get here (not so great) and it didn't solve the problem. SO I called Graco again and they said they would send out the non-motor side of the swing because it looked like it was that side that had stopped working properly. They sent me another motor!! So I called them again and AGAIN they sent me the wrong part!It's now been a month that I have not been able to use the swing. I had to speak with a supervisor to persuade them to send me out a new swing, but they insisted that I send in the old one first and then I would have to wait for it to get there and then wait another two weeks to get the replacement. This was unacceptable considering that I have already been unable to use the swing for a month.  Finally they agreed to send the new swing and I'm waiting for it now.Do all of these break or was I just unlucky? I'm looking forward to being able to use this swing again.

But it has so many shortcomings for me that I'm honestly conflicted about it.First of all, it showed up in a sealed, sturdy box but inside everything was just bouncing around. There were cardboard inserts and foam pieces that were supposed to be tucked and wrapped around parts just so, but were instead bouncing around loosely inside the box. One of the clips that holds the foot rest was broken, the plastic handle that adjusts the recline of the seat had come off and was loose in the box, and two of the metal supports were bent on the ends to where it was very difficult to get the parts to fit together (I managed to get them together but I'm certain one of the joints will never come back apart again).I'm also not a fan of instruction manuals that consist of nothing but photos. There are many pages of black and white illustrations that show you how all the parts assemble together but some verbiage would have been nice.Now onto the pro/con list:I love that the back on this seat reclines. However, unless the seat is in the furthest reclined position (and therefore leaning against the support beam that prevents it from reclining any further) it's extremely flimsy and my son has made a game out of pushing against it and flexing it since it gives so much. I know it's just a matter of time before the system that holds the back in place breaks.I love the dense foam back and seat cushions versus the typical fabric style so often used as they're easy to remove and clean but I hate that the only thing holding the back rest in place is the shoulder straps that thread through it. If not for the shoulder straps it would just be loosely sitting there. Every time I remove my son from this chair I seem to have to adjust the foam back into its proper place.This chair is on four wheels which is a welcome feature over my previous stationary chair. Unfortunately the front wheels only have about a 90 degree range of motion so forget about rolling this thing sideways. The way my dining area is oriented, my son's high chair needs to be moved sideways into place so despite the wheels I still find myself picking it up and moving it that way.As I mentioned earlier the seat has shoulder straps. My son is beyond the age of needing to be strapped in to this extent but because of the fact that the back foam depends on these straps to stay in place you can't just remove them. I did remove them and I used ribbon to loop through the holes in the foam and seat and tied it together behind the chair. It works but it's not ideal and in my opinion not something you should have to worry about on a product at this price point.I like the fact that the high chair seat can be removed, turning the high chair into a toddler chair (very similar to the wooden high chairs you find at restaurants) but I really don't like how flimsy the latch is that holds the high chair seat in place.One thing I will say is that the tray is nice. I love the sliding motion and how can be set in numerous positions for a perfect fit. Also, this high chair is larger and sits up higher than my Fisher Price chair which my son seems to love and I'm confident that it will fit him much longer.I have a serious love/hate relationship with this chair. I'll keep using it and may reach out to the manufacturer regarding the broken clip on the foot rest. Time will tell if the negatives outweigh the positives enough to compel me to replace it. In the world of high chairs there are so many options that I would recommend shopping around to get exactly what you want. At this price point I would expect all of the pieces and parts of this seat be solid and feel secure. In fact, my Fisher Price chair (which retails for about half of this one) feels infinitely more solid and durable.

Not convertible with growth. Difficult to clean. Very poor design.", "review": "At first glance, this looks like a perfect high chair-- it's a beautiful wooden stand with convertible steps, the ability to \"grow\" with your child, and the ease of clean-up (no fabric to launder). However, it is a nightmare to clean, and its safety is questionable. I have been using this chair for about one year now from the time my baby was 6 months old to 1.5 years. She is petite and lean, but has already outgrown the seat at just 21lbs. We removed the middle insert thinking we would just pull her up to the table, but it doesn't go under the table. The plastic arms prevent you from pulling it in close enough to reach the table at a safe distance, and the straps go away with the middle insert so there is no way to strap in the baby once it is removed. Therefore, there is no way it grows with your child if it is inoperable when you convert it. Without the middle insert you also cannot use the tray, as it uses the insert to lock into place or else it falls right out when the baby leans on it. The worst feature of this chair though is the tray itself. There is no way to wash it. I learned the hard way by putting it into the sink the first week I used it. You'd think you could wash your high chair tray?! And why wouldn't you want to wash it? Unfortunately for this design, there are several pieces of plastic screwed together and they are not water tight. The tray collects the water inside, and you have to shake it vigorously to get it out (usually to no avail). The tray grew mildew in the seams, and I contacted Oxo Tot asking for a replacement. They obliged immediately with top notch customer service; however, they did advise me not to wash the tray in water. They said to \"wipe only\". I wanted to ask them if it was intended for food... So I \"wipe\" with diluted alcohol now. I never feel like it gets 100% clean like this, and I would never have asked for this high chair on my registry had I known I could never wash it. I have used a handful of other high chairs now when traveling, and all of them have trays that are dishwasher safe (let alone hand-washing safe). Thirdly, the padding on the seat is adhered with a strong velcro. You can remove the pad to wash it, but do not try to wash the velcro, or \"wipe\" it. You will end up with very dirty velcro if you touch it. I have removed the pads twice, and the second time I swore I would never do it again because the chair looked dirtier than it did before. Finally, the chair does not move easily. It is heavy due to the wood, and there are no wheels. If you have tile or wood floors, be very careful not to scrape or chip it. I had Travertine at my last house, and chipped several areas of my floor just from every day use. Every time I use this chair (at least twice a day), I feel worried that my child is sitting and eating on a dirty chair that might not be safe. I am looking for a cheaper, easier chair now (with wheels and a dishwasher safe tray). When you're a first time parent, you don't always know what you need. I wish I had known that I did NOT need this chair. It is only beautiful to look at but not useful (and actually causes more stress than it should). This is a very expensive high chair to just be turned into a decor piece... it should be completely functional at the price point. I am incredibly dissatisfied with this product, and I would not recommend it to any other parent, unless you want daily headaches and less time spent with your child while you \"wipe\" every particle of food off the tray and then hand-sanitize it 3x's a day.", "review_id": "RLV7DM40J4FMX", "asin": "B01644POHE", "proba": "52.64%", "product_name": "OXO Tot Sprout High Chair, Gray/White"}, {"id": 857, "title": "Two Stars", "review": "Terrible quality.

(so you can reuse once the baby phase is over).We didnt fix the 4th wall (so its Daybed like)- We have 3 walls (Back+2 sides fixed) and have attached it to the side of our Cal-King Mattress so that its easy to pick up the baby at night, feed him and put him back. (acts just like an extension to the master bed-(but if you do this please make sure there is NO gap between the bed and the crib!)In our particular case, this arrangement also has some other benefits:- Lets our 4 year old who still sleeps in the center be where he is- without accidentally hurting the infant during sleep.- Lets us pull the comforter up without risking choking the infant.The Bad:- One of the screws came with a bad thread, so it wont go in fully, and is stuck half way. Now I need to call Graco and ask them for a replacement screw.(Will have to see how that goes). Also noticed that the other screw threads overall weren't of that great quality. How does that affect you? If you do not screw the screws in perfectly, you have a chance of messing up the thread on the screws and then you wont be able to get it in at all/damage it permanently.- The positioning of the barrel nuts (into which the screws go in) is pathetic. You have to sort of 'suspend' it at the perfect depth to get the screw in. This would not have happened if the depth's were accurate, or if the barrel nuts were pre- set in the hole. Would have made it much easier for the customer. (Just shows lack of attention to detail in manufacturing). Bottom line- it took 2 engineers over and hour to fix this.- The packaging is about ~4ft x 5ft. So wont fit into a sedan or even a small SUV. So dont expect IKEA-like packaging that optimizes knockdowns, and every inch for portability.Overall not a bad product, But if only they had paid attention to the critical details (!), or if someone at Graco had actually tried assembling this before shipping it to new parents who by the way have nothing else to do than grapple with faulty designs.

My son was only in this when he was sleeping and he very rarely was in a swing or other infant seat.  Typically if he was awake he was being held or attempting tummy time.  Unfortunately he liked to sleep with the back of his head against the sleeper and with his face looking straight up at the ceiling and he developed a flat spot on the back of his head.  We moved him into his crib when we noticed the flat spot.  Since he liked to sleep with his face looking up in the sleeper he did the same in his crib and the flat spot got worse despite turning him.  After several thousand dollars in x-rays, fancy scans and pediatric plastic surgeon visits he is wearing a helmet.  I believe that if my son had slept in something softer and more forgiving to his soft head the flat spot wouldn't have formed.The idea behind this product is fantastic.  If they could make the hard plastic softer it would be a great product, but until then I would warn new parents to be extremely cautious when using this product.", "review_id": "R1SZMZT22CMUQF", "asin": "B002M77N22", "proba": "51.77%", "product_name": "Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow (Discontinued by Manufacturer)"}, {"id": 865, "title": "I purchased this item on Feb.

They gave me a number to call the distributor (LAJOBI??); so I did, and asked the same question; LAJOBI's customer service said there's nothing they can do, and keep stating the paint is toxic free...FYI, I just received my new order (AFG Athena Nadia Crib) today; with comparison with GRACO Lauren crib side by side; the AFG Athena crib has no smell at all; hard wood are much thicker/stronger; and all pieces are so smooth.

While putting it together, most of the pre-drilled holes used to house the screws for assembly were splintered and shred so bits of wood flaked off around them.  After completing the assembly, the legs were totally uneven and it wobbled back and forth.  I attempted to adjust the very cheap bases to the legs, but nothing helped.  I considered adding a small base to one leg to fix the issue, but decided for the money we spent, we should have a quality product.  My 9 month old son tried it for a day with napkins folded under one leg and seemed comfortable enough.  The straps were extremely thin and quickly loosened.  The cushion was nice and seemed easy to clean.  The tray surface was very nice also, but difficult to remove from the chair.We were very excited about this product based on other reviews and because we liked the design.
